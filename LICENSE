This modpack is free and open source for everyone to modify, redistribute as their own, or as part of a larger project AS LONG AS IT COMPLIES WITH THE LICENSES OF EACH OF THE MODS IN THIS PACK. I do not own any of the mods in this pack and am only able to share this because of the hard work of the mod developers.
