content registration.\n<ul>\n<li>For Blocks, HammerLib automagically registers BlockItem(s). If you want to disable BlockItem(s), let your block implement&nbsp;INoItemBlock, ICustomBlockItem, or&nbsp;ICreativeTabBlock, depending on what you want to achieve.</li>\n<li>For&nbsp;BlockEntity rendering, custom BlockEntityType constants may have additional @TileRenderer, pointing to an&nbsp;IBESR&lt;Tile&gt; class.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Old-styled language parsers in format of \"key=value\", instead of JSONs (the file names and format is like in older game versions, but you need to call LanguageAdapter.registerMod(MOD_ID); inside your mod's constructor for it to register.</li>\n<li>Mod Source checks, that allow you to check if the mod was downloaded from adware/malware sites, AND warn users about it.</li>\n<li>Java-based recipe registration with a simple&nbsp;RegisterRecipesEvent, that runs on HammerLib.EVENT_BUS, allowing you, as a developer, to register crafting recipes like before, with code.</li>\n<li>Java-based tag population, with&nbsp;BuildTagsEvent, that runs on HammerLib.EVENT_BUS.</li>\n<li>Vastly simplified networking, using Network class, and IPacket + INBTPacket to allow for flawless and intuitive packet code development.</li>\n<li>Wrappers for block harvesting, that has been moved over to tags - BlockHarvestAdapter</li>\n<li>Field-based NBT serialization, so that you don't make a typo/forget to write serialization/deserialization code.</li>\n<li>Good old TileEntity wrappers, with TileSyncable and TileSyncableTickable, that allow synchronization of initial state, as well as registering properties that will be synchronized independently.</li>\n<li>ContainerAPI for BlockEntities, allowing to avoid MenuType&lt;?&gt; altogether (no need to register screen providers, menu types etc)</li>\n<li>ItemStack -&gt; Color[] API, with&nbsp;TexturePixelGetter.getAllColors</li>\n<li>Annotation-based custom model loaders (@LoadUnbakedGeometry on IUnbakedGeometry&lt;SELF&gt;), avoids using the geometry loader class by making a common wrapper.</li>\n<li>...And a whole lot more!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And a lot of rich features for mod devs.</p>\n<p><strong>Not enough?

(primarily used to support the random model feature, the config screen, and allow textures set in models to vary like in OptiFine)\n\n#### Highly recommended\n- [Entity Culling](https://modrinth.com/mod/entityculling): This mod does wonders for reducing entity rendering lag, doing even more than Sodium's included entity culling. This is very beneficial when using animation heavy packs like Fresh Animations.\n\n\n## Fresh Animations?\nYes.\n\nit works :)\n\n<img width=\"450\" src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/images/2f32dbeadc25e46ef6c56f0e47e5eb5d305c8ea2.png\">\n\n<br>\n\n[Download Fresh Animations](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/fresh-animations-v1-0/)\n\n\n## Features & OptiFine differences & Known Bugs\n\nUp-to-date feature details page : [Features & Optifine differences](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Model_Features/blob/master/FEATURES.md)\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n> **Q:** Do all OptiFine CEM resource packs work?\n\n**A:** Most packs work fine, but I'm sure there are some exceptions, report any found issues [here](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Model_Features/issues), or on my [discord](https://discord.com/invite/rURmwrzUcz).\n\n> **Q:** What's different between EMF and dorianpb's [CEM](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem)?\n\n**A:** EMF is in a complete state and has a nearly 1 to 1 parity with OptiFine CEM, EMF also does a few extra things like player animations and armor model support, with more ideas on the way :)\n\nEMF also does things differently under the hood with little to no hardcoding of support for vanilla models. Allowing full CEM support for various modded entities.\n\n> **Q:** Backports?\n\n**A:** Backports to 1.18 & 1.19 are planned.\nBackports to version 1.17 and below are not planned at this time.\n\n## License\n\nEMF is licensed under the [GNU Lesser Public License](LICENSE), version 3.0","published":"2023-03-31T23:58:40.453948Z","updated":"2023-10-03T09:07:54.950827Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":365276,"followers":1086,"categories":["mobs","utility"],"additional_categories":["decoration"],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20-pre1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["yYaRtPUw","nXG5ZTWm","pcLQFqon","rVKOnrA7","T7mzJLz6","Dea94PIY","DjswzKtj","aDp7snRT","V2OyfXxm","Xd7QIIv1","GlVrMJfd","TEAO0eWy","6WfVnhiq","3ArUcFku","zTnuaNyR","I8BdGIyR","7bzU6chG","deVKWS49","MjDE57Jw","weH0Em4N","OZhKhqbO","Y4ERRvDT","7eRoc49u","8GH17mIS","NZKwy6yr","AzRidGwG","IL4RqqYZ","mOmY1cMH","EYEiSxf5","PuJLEdhx","5v32yTeK","F2rVuihD","kouKrQ96","ZZGFPXZF","ORrfX7aq","OPyB18gz","yVjuZyf5","e9hB4Qyw","NF2Ro84F","yHUWdpcz","nqu0vi2x","lu9zjvWC","n1DH6PLf","VfoKtE8J","akfHUoQf","TVhwNuR0","4jkePyqP","E6OJ69z6","ZAuTqMfx","c9lEcqYf","30r5YeHU","LnM9TQxd","wEcxaFJT","slWSM9OY","9ODYgM48","n6EyQyeN","b1pJegrh","p1Qt8SIh","33ddTlVK","VBeUopG1","S8VuZDQ4","nIQedooe","PETiI2Yb","yGROrq68","8FU1BYfi","JtRlIyBy","z0tRTgFX","9N7ilgif","hVYDL7YQ","kFcIMH1Z","r0UjM8gx","NtxuH8Wk","toEX8PUQ","hBdLuluo","L5j5Cgt6","Fhs6XUdV","j6G5CGoD","UTk9KIPl","zO7oFMiv","4e3OPRfB","eg7GqpgR","KKMsC88r","h4PnMR7D","AXMXly1R","K22doPG2","F3Urf59I","BA8z5Ryk","P6h6WCIY","PRB8TBBT"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/5e127e83e3b55e3cebf32e3e8b355296ea62d87d.png"},"version":{"id":"30r5YeHU","project_id":"4I1XuqiY","author_id":"rLbuLV6t","featured":false,"name":"0.2.13","version_number":"0.2.13","changelog":"- fixed `IndexOutOfBoundsException` & `already building` crashes related to texture overrides in sub-models\n- added an option to select how to handle texture overrides on sub-model parts, whether to rely on EMF's rendering code, an Iris rendering quirk, or to disable them.*(this should almost always be left on default except when debugging texture overrides in sub-models)*","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-07-13T07:06:32.534504Z","downloads":152,"version_type":"beta","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"bed270179089f2d53597f444fe0bc512592d909e331bfce2cd0581e7f2f5421d776c3f6236a3d996c3164431883018baded29e025f89a9559aed4a8ceaf00d2a","sha1":"7d1764cda5fa0407f1d31a6a518909da701e939b"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/versions/30r5YeHU/entity_model_features_forge_1.19.3-0.2.13.jar","filename":"entity_model_features_forge_1.19.3-0.2.13.jar","primary":true,"size":481170,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19.3"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"fXLgMy6f","user":{"id":"rLbuLV6t","username":"Traben","name":"Traben","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8456487?v=4","bio":"What even is OptiFine?","created":"2022-01-26T01:51:52.290422Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":{"id":"h4PnMR7D","project_id":"4I1XuqiY","author_id":"rLbuLV6t","featured":false,"name":"[EMF] Entity Model Features 1.0.2","version_number":"1.0.2","changelog":"- fixed situational lag in v1.0 related to block entity rendering\n\n- fixed 1.19 forge issue preventing block entity model syncing (i.e chest and trapped_chest both using chest.jem)\n\nthis might be the last 1.19.3 version","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-23T08:16:17.093860Z","downloads":30,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"f94e5796542e9e6303278b56647564a595a7fa5027a773a6fc3d41e0bfbabd5dd4b703f17d37fce62b2d9ffba7b3f917a76662055308a992b02d961522a3398f","sha1":"22c3db13c325b38c7782703b2362a89d47a86b11"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/versions/h4PnMR7D/entity_model_features_forge_1.19.3-1.0.2.jar","filename":"entity_model_features_forge_1.19.3-1.0.2.jar","primary":true,"size":285042,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"BVzZfTc1","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.19.3"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"incompatible":true},"file_name":"entity_model_features_forge_1.19.3-0.2.13.jar"},"mods\\Tips-Forge-1.19.3-9.0.3.jar":{"sha512":"22f11ef1cd791faff65c608b8776141db1a70a40d5046c4d974dfe1c8d49423e3de81bc866a9dcbf4946f4f939d4f4550d6fe1fa2576273b02295ea52ba00a9f","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"AMCbgyVw","slug":"tips","project_type":"mod","team":"SEOvZNdW","title":"Tips","description":"This mod adds tips to loading menus.

Make sure to test your results to see if you require it.\n\n## About\n\nSimplified AI modification mod focused on performance and low-level modifications to AIs in the game. Picking up the slack for the base game and improving it for a modded ecosystem. Handling common problems such as too many animals, performance hits from swarms of zombies, and simple remove tasks skipped by larger AI improvement mods.\n\n## Story\n\nAI Improvements was born out of the need to improve server performance for large heavily modded servers. As any experienced server owner will know a server's CPU clock time is eaten away by mods all trying to fight over resources. Most server owners and developers will try to attack this problem by trimming mods. Rather than going after the mods installed I started to look at Minecraft itself. Focusing down on how it was designed to work and how it lent to performance problems.\n\nI found that as a server's population grows so does the amount of entities and other resources. At first, I thought \"lets reduce the spawn rate of mobs on the server\" this lead to a complaint about mob farming. Even with testing, it didn't show a major solution to the problem. So rather than taking that approach, I decided to improve how the AI's function. This resulted in a lot of resource and insight into different areas. After many hours, I found my solution and created this mod. \n\n## FAQ \n\n<ins>I installed but didn't see a large gain as promised?</ins>\\\nNewer versions of MC implement fixes for the AI. With the last few versions, the rotation fix was implemented in addition to other fixes. Thus, the impact of this mod is much lower than in older versions.\n\n<ins>Can this be installed on the server only?</ins>\\\nYes, the mod is coded to function without it being client side\n\n<ins>Can this be installed on the client only?</ins>\\\nYes, though it may not do much to improve fps. \n\n<ins>Where is the config?</ins>\\\n`.minecraft/config/bbm/AI_Improvements.cfg`\n\n<ins>What will happen if I disable the EntityLookHelper replacement?</ins>\\\nYou're not going to see much of an improvement in the AI code. However, if you enabled the other disable configs it should be fine.\n\n<ins>How does this mod work for fixing performance?</ins>\\\nIt depends on the feature and version of Minecraft. Most of the performance comes from caching heavily calculated values. This has the result of reducing CPU time at the cost of an ignorable amount of RAM. See feature list for exacts...\n\n## Current Features:\n\n### Config to disable AI Watch Closest Entity\n\nBy default the config is set to false and will not do anything. When changed to true it will remove an AI segment called EntityAIWatchClosest. This AI segment handles the coded AIs use to rotate their head towards a nearby entity.Visually this will cause a few odd issues. However, for the CPU this frees up a lot of usage caused by entities. \n\n### Config to disable AI look random, config is not enabled by default\n\nBy default the config is set to false and will not do anything. Setting the config to true will cause entities to no longer use the 'look idle' AI code. This can improve performance for servers will large populations. As almost every entity on the map will use this when not doing anything important. Visually this can cause the entities head to not rotate sometimes but mostly goes unnoticed.\n\n### Config to replace EntityLookHelper with a more efficient version, config is enabled by default\n\nThis is the main feature of the mod and can greatly improve CPU performance at a small cost to RAM. How this works is MC's look helper code is replaced with a custom version. The custom version stores some data that makes it faster to get the angle for a location. Threw some testing with VisualVM result have shown a 50% to 80% decrease in CPU usage by the AI code.

It is also <strong>the first rotating square minimap for Minecraft. </strong>Among a wide variety of customization settings, there is an option for a <strong>circle-shaped minimap</strong> and a separate setting for <strong>locking the minimap's rotation</strong> (using a direction arrow instead). The minimap can display the surrounding entities, including <strong>players, mobs and items</strong>, as <strong>dots with a custom color</strong> or as <strong>icons (usually heads)</strong>. In addition to the default <strong>compass directions</strong>, you can place your own&nbsp;<strong>waypoints </strong>that are visible both on the minimap and in the game world.&nbsp;Waypoints help you find previously visited locations or reach specific coordinates, with <strong>optional teleportation</strong>. The minimap can display the surrounding blocks above ground and below ground (<strong>cave mode</strong>). These are just some of the features of the mod while there are many more. Please read the \"Minimap features\" section below for a more complete list. For the purposes of following multiplayer server rules, there are 2 mod editions, full and fair-play, the latter being designed for fair PVP.&nbsp;<strong>This mod is mostly client-sided. Installing it on the server side is optional for some additional features like world identification.</strong></p>\n\n### Follow me on Mastodon (Twitter alternative)?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mas.to/@xaero96\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">mas.to/@xaero96</a>\n\n### Support me on Patreon?</strong>&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://bit.ly/PatreonXaero96\">patreon.com/xaero96</a></span>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n\n### Features\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Look of vanilla Minecraft</strong>.</li>\n<li>Multiple minimap size options including automatic.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Multiple zoom options.</li>\n<li>Two minimap shape options: <strong>square or circle</strong>.</li>\n<li>Runs&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">smoother than a lot of minimap mods</strong>.</li>\n<li>Can be placed anywhere on the screen using the \"Change Position\" setting/screen.

You can also enable biome colors for the Vanilla mode using a separate setting.</li>\n<li>A custom key binding (Z by default) to temporarily enlarge the minimap to take a better look around.&nbsp;<strong>All key bindings are in the vanilla controls menu.&nbsp;</strong>There are also settings for controlling the behavior of the minimap when it is enlarged, for example to center the minimap on the screen or to fully zoom out the minimap.</li>\n<li>Map shading customization with the \"Terrain Depth\" and \"Terrain Slopes\" settings.</li>\n<li>Compatible with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Xaero's World Map</a>. By default uses the map textures generated by the world map mod instead of generating its own. This improves performance when using both mods.</li>\n<li>Option to limit your minimap access by binding it to an item required in your hotbar or to be equipped. For example, add <em>minimapItemId:minecraft:compass</em> anywhere in the config file to bind it to the compass item. This way the minimap will not be displayed unless you have the compass in your hotbar or equipped.</li>\n<li>Potion effects to control the usage of the minimap or some of its features for the players on your server/map. The following potion effects exist as of writing this: <em>xaerominimap:no_minimap, xaerominimap:no_entity_radar, xaerominimap:no_waypoints, xaerominimap:no_cave_maps. </em>The effects are of the neutral type by default, but you can also specify a harmful type by appending <em>_harmful</em>&nbsp;to the end of the effect ID, for example&nbsp;<em>xaerominimap:no_entity_radar_harmful</em>.</li>\n<li>Translated to a lot of languages.</li>\n<li>Option to&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">lock north</strong>&nbsp;to stop the minimap from rotating and instead display the direction of your character with an arrow.</li>\n<li>Works both above and under ground thanks to the&nbsp;<strong>automatic cave mode</strong>. Cave mode should also activate inside buildings. You can choose the size of the \"solid roof\" above you that the mod searches for to activate cave mode. Roof size 3x3 and above should prevent cave mode activation when standing under log blocks while cutting wood.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Waypoints</strong>. Practically an infinite amount. Can be teleported to (permission for teleportation chat command needed). Waypoints are rendered in the game world and displayed on the minimap. You can hide all or specific waypoints. Press&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">B</strong>&nbsp;to create a new waypoint. Press&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">U</strong>&nbsp;to list all the waypoints. In the waypoints list, you can add/edit a single or multiple waypoints, sort them, view waypoints from other sub-worlds/dimensions and much more.</li>\n<li><strong>Local and global waypoints. </strong>To clear the screen from unnecessary waypoints you can create local waypoints that, unlike global ones, are affected by the \"Max WP Draw Distance\" option. This enables you to set a single global waypoint for a large area/region and multiple local ones in the area/region. Only the global waypoints will be visible when you are beyond the maximum draw distance.</li>\n<li><strong>Waypoint sets.</strong>&nbsp;You can organize your waypoints by sorting them into sets. Your current set can be quickly switched with a key binding. <strong>All key bindings are in the vanilla controls menu.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Waypoint sharing</strong>. You can share your waypoints in the game chat with players on the server. This is done from the waypoints list (press U).</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Deathpoints</strong>. An&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">automatic skull-shaped waypoint</strong>&nbsp;is created&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">on each death</strong>.

The chunks where slimes can spawn are marked with a green overlay.</li>\n<li><strong>Custom light overlay</strong>. You can setup a light overlay that will mark blocks with a custom color if they are within a custom light value range, which is block light from 0 to 7 by default. The default settings are meant for finding mob-spawnable blocks. You can use it for any purpose.</li>\n<li>Multi-world detection in multiplayer. If you install the minimap mod on the server side in addition to the client side, each server world should get a separate waypoints \"sub-world\". Otherwise a much less reliable world separation is used, which is based on the world spawnpoint. If you can't install the mod on the server side, it is recommended to turn off multi-world detection for servers that only have a single \"world\". You can do it through the <em>Waypoints Menu (press U) -&gt; Options</em> screen.</li>\n<li>Displays&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">mobs</strong>&nbsp;on the map as&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">yellow dots.</strong>&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Hostile and friendly</strong>&nbsp;mobs can be colored&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">differently. </strong>Can also be displayed as <strong>icons/heads</strong>.&nbsp;Check the <strong>\"Entity Radar\"</strong> settings.</li>\n<li>Displays&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">players</strong>&nbsp;on the map as&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">white dots or player heads.&nbsp;</strong>Can also be displayed as <strong>icons/heads</strong>.&nbsp;Check the <strong>\"Entity Radar\"</strong> settings.</li>\n<li>Displays&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">items</strong>&nbsp;on the map as&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">red dots. </strong>Check the <strong>\"Entity Radar\"</strong> settings.</li>\n<li>Displays all the&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">other entities</strong>&nbsp;such as arrows and item frames as&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">purple dots</strong><span class=\"bbc\">.</span><strong class=\"bbc\">&nbsp;</strong>Different types of entities can be disabled in the settings.&nbsp;Check the <strong>\"Entity Radar\"</strong> settings.</li>\n<li>Options for <strong>displaying entity names </strong>on the minimap<strong>&nbsp;</strong>in the \"Entity Radar\" settings.</li>\n<li>Zoom in and out key bindings&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">(I and O by default) </strong>to efficiently change the zoom level to fit your preference or use case.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Coordinates&nbsp;</strong>under the minimap.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Current biome name</strong>&nbsp;under the minimap.

The mod sends a chat command&nbsp;to teleport you to the waypoints, which is <em>/tp @s x y z </em>by default, so appropriate permission is necessary. The vanilla <em>/tp</em> command requires OP status (cheats enabled) but it's possible to have separate permissions for commands on a non-vanilla server with certain plugins installed. The used command can be changed in the minimap settings with the \"Default Teleport Command\" option or per server in the waypoints menu with the \"Teleport Chat Command\" option. Non-vanilla teleportation commands often don't support the selectors such as @s, so you might have to remove it from the configured command. Right-click teleportation on the world map uses its own setting for the command. You can read about it on the world map description page under FAQ.</p>\n<p>If the \"Teleport\" button is disabled, then it can also mean multiple things. The most common reason for this is manually using waypoints from a sub-world that isn't the \"auto\" one but still from the same dimension. If the \"auto\" sub-world isn't what is supposed to be automatically picked on a certain world, then select the correct sub-world and use \"Make Sub-world Auto\" in the waypoints menu Options. This will swap all waypoints data between the 2 sub-worlds and you'll be able to teleport to the waypoints, which are now in your \"auto\" sub-world.</p>\n<p>If the \"auto\" sub-world IS selected but the teleport button is still disabled, then it probably means that teleportation was manually disabled for the server/world. Check the teleportation option in the waypoints menu Options. If it's disabled, you can only enable it through the server-specific config file in the game directory -&gt; XaeroWaypoints. I recommend exiting Minecraft before editing any config files. And make backups from time to time.</p>\n\n### Why are my waypoints no longer shown for a specific server?\n\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted. If you use the world map mod and it has also reset, then please start by restoring it first before dealing with the waypoints. Read the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">\"Why has my world map \"reset\" for a specific server?\"</em>&nbsp;section on the world map&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">description page</a>. Done with that? Please continue reading.</p>\n<p>Start by opening the full waypoint menu. Press U ingame to do so. Check the vanilla controls menu, if the U key doesn't work. Go through the sub-worlds listed in the top-right dropdown menu. All waypoint sub-worlds for the current server address should be there. If none of them have the right waypoints for the world/dimension that you are in,&nbsp;then the server address was likely changed. Find the old server address in the top-<strong class=\"bbc\">LEFT</strong>&nbsp;dropdown menu, select it and do&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Options -&gt; Make World/Server Auto</em>. You should now be able to find the correct sub-world in the top-right dropdown menu. If the right sub-world is already marked with (auto), which means that the sub-world is automatically selected for your current world/dimension, then you should be good to go. If the wrong sub-world is marked with (auto), then please continue reading.</p>\n<p><u><em class=\"bbc\">Using the world map mod?</em></u><br />One of the most common reasons for the wrong sub-world being automatically selected is the incorrect usage of the world map mod in multiplayer (since version 1.6).&nbsp;Make sure you select the correct map for your current world before confirming it. It affects which waypoints are being shown to you. The menu for map selection is on the world map screen, if you click the bottom left icon (unless it's open by default). Consider changing the map selection mode to one of the automatic ones, if it fits the server you're playing on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your currently confirmed map affects which waypoints sub-world in the minimap mod is considered automatic (auto). This allows each created map to have separate waypoints data. At any point in time, you can select and view any non-automatic waypoints sub-world by going to the waypoints menu (press U) and selecting it from top-right dropdown menu. You can make any sub-world automatic for your currently confirmed map by selecting&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Options -&gt; Make Sub-World Auto</em>.</p>\n<p><u><em class=\"bbc\">Not using the world map mod?</u></em>&nbsp;<br />The wrong sub-world being considered (auto) and therefore being automatically selected can be caused by a server plugin changing the behavior of the vanilla compass item and interfering with the mod's \"multiworld\" detection, if you have it enabled (disabled by default). In most such cases the compass item points to your bed instead of the global spawn point. Sleeping in the right bed again should bring everything back for you if sleeping in another one was the cause of the waypoints disappearing.<br />If this happened because of a new plugin being added (and if removing it is not an option for you), then here's how you can restore your waypoints:</p>\n<p>1. Find the right waypoints \"sub-world\" from the top-right dropdown menu in the waypoints screen, it's the one with the waypoints that you need in your current dimension. Perhaps start with overworld?</p>\n<p>2. Use&nbsp;<em>Options -&gt; Make sub-world auto.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>3. Do the same for every dimension (enter the dimensions before doing it!).</p>\n<p>4. If it's a simple server with 1 world (no hub/lobby worlds, no minigame worlds, creative plot worlds etc), then also turn off \"Multiworld Detection\" in the same&nbsp;<em>Options&nbsp;</em>menu. You can turn it back on later if you ever need it.<br /><br /><em style=\"font-size: 1.2rem;\">Contact me if you have questions!</em></p>\n\n### How do I add my own entity icons or override the default ones?\n\n<p><strong>First of all, make sure that you actually have the entity icons/heads enabled in the minimap settings -&gt; Entity Radar Categories, whether you put it on \"Always\" or \"Player List\". Just make sure that you know how to display them. Those are the icons that this section is about.</strong></p>\n<p>Starting from version 21.6.0 of the minimap mod you are able to override the default icons displayed for entities with your own sprites/images by making a resource pack (or including the required resources in your own mod). In addition to that, you are also able to add or improve entity type variants support (different variants of the same entity type having different icons) by creating a simple mod of your own or including some code in your existing mod. Although this is usually unnecessary for simpler multi-variant entity types (most entity types).<br />By default, the minimap mod renders all entity icons using the entity renderers/models bound to the entities. This supports all vanilla mobs and some simple bipedal/quadrupedal mobs whose models have easily identifiable head model parts (head, ears, nose etc). If the mod fails to do so, the colored dot is displayed instead.</p>\n<p>The relevant assets directory to the purpose of overriding the icons is&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/</em>. You can find it inside the minimap mod's jar file and extract the contained files/folders for your reference. The jar contains an example file for overriding icons of a mod entity type&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/example_mod/example_entity.json</em>. The example file would corresponds to the entity type&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">example_mod:example_entity</em>, if such existed. Please read the comments in the file&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">example_entity.json</em>&nbsp;to learn about its structure, so that you are able to create your own icon definitions similar to it.<br />In addition to that,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/minecraft/</em>&nbsp;contains several example files for vanilla entity types that might require additional comments regarding the default entity type variants support. By default, entities have very simple variants support where the entity type variant ID is simply the entity's main texture resource location.<br />If you set the \"<em>debugEntityVariantIds</em>\" option in the minimap config file to true, then the variant IDs of newly encountered entities (variants) will be printed in the chat and the log/console.</p>\n<p>Starting from version 21.8.0 of the minimap mod you are also able to configure your own model-based rendering. Please read the comments in the example file&nbsp;<em>/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/example_mod/example_entity.json</em>&nbsp;for all the information you need to know.</p>\n<p>Check out this awesome project by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/babybluetit\">babybluetit</a>, if you want to have a look at a real implementation of custom icons or actually use it:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/xaeros-minimap-modded-support\">https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/xaeros-minimap-modded-support</a></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>You are allowed to make videos using this mod.</strong></em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>Using it in your modpacks is allowed with the following conditions: </strong></em></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong><b><i>Only monetization of the modpack through CurseForge or Modrinth is allowed (which includes sponsored links/banners in your modpack description), unless I have given you written permission to monetize it elsewhere.

","body":"Mouse Tweaks replaces the standard RMB dragging mechanic, adds two new LMB dragging mechanics and an ability to quickly move items with the scroll wheel.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install a compatible mod loader:\n    - 1.16.5 and later: install Minecraft Forge or Fabric.\n    - 1.14.4 and later: install Minecraft Forge.\n    - 1.12.2 and earlier: install either Minecraft Forge or LiteLoader (or both).\n2. Put the Mouse Tweaks jar-file into the mods folder in your .minecraft directory.\n\n### Extras\n\n[**Mouse Tweaks API**](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/tree/master/src/main/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api)\n\nConfiguration file: `.minecraft/config/MouseTweaks.cfg`\n\n## Tweaks\n\n### RMB Tweak\n\nVery similar to the standard RMB dragging mechanic, with one difference: if you drag over a slot multiple times, an item will be put there multiple times. Replaces the standard mechanic if enabled.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `RMBTweak=1`\n\nHold your right mouse button:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Uo7xF.png)\n\nDrag your mouse around the crafting grid:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NCRED.png)\n\nYou can drag your mouse on top of existing items:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6MQv6.png)\n\n### LMB Tweak (with item)\n\nLets you quickly pick up or move items of the same type.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithItem=1`\n\nHold your left mouse button to pick up an item:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ziuGG.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items of the same type will be picked up:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JDjsE.png?2)\n\nHold shift and drag. Items of the same type will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YrvmT.png?2)\n\n### LMB Tweak (without item)\n\nQuickly move items into another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithoutItem=1`\n\nHold shift, then hold your left mouse button:\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f9Ejp.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qBu6k.png?2)\n\n### Wheel Tweak\n\nScroll to quickly move items between inventories. When you scroll down on an item stack, its items will be moved one by one. When you scroll up, items will be moved into it from another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelTweak=1`\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelSearchOrder=1`\n\nWhen you scroll up, the mod will search for items from last to first (when this is set to 1) or from first to last (when this is set to 0).\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelScrollDirection=0`\n\nSet this to 1 to invert the default scroll actions. So, when set to 1, scrolling down will pull the items and scrolling up will push the items.\n\nSet this to 2 to enable the inventory position aware scrolling. Scrolling up will push the items into the other inventory if it's above the selected slot, or pull items from the other inventory if it's below the selected slot. Vice versa for scrolling down.\n\n### Obsolete / Removed Settings\n\nThese settings existed in older Mouse Tweaks versions but were removed since.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `OnTickMethodOrder=Forge, LiteLoader`\n\nMouse Tweaks can use multiple APIs for an OnTick method that it requires. You can use this setting to control the API it prefers. This shouldn't really matter at all. If a method isn't supported (for example, you don't have the API installed) the mod will proceed to check the next ones.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `ScrollHandling=0`\n\nToggles between \"smooth scrolling, minor issues\" (0) and \"non-smooth scrolling, no issues\" (1). When set to smooth scrolling, minor issues may be experienced such as scrolling \"through\" JEI or other mods. When set to non-smooth scrolling, those issues will not happen, but the scrolling will be a little non-smooth. Non-smooth scrolling works only with the Forge OnTick method.\n\nThis option is set to smooth scrolling by default because the aforementioned issues require rather specific conditions to trigger and aren't very impactful, while scrolling items is something you do all the time and want the experience to be as good as possible.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nMouse Tweaks is compatible with everything based on `GuiContainer` (as long as the behavior isn't changed too much).\n\nIf your GUI isn't based on `GuiContainer`, or if you want to improve compatibility (making Mouse Tweaks ignore some slot, for example), take a look at the [API documentation](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/blob/2dc5bb108c2663f9a07b3a181483733a0274b41a/src/api/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api/IMTModGuiContainer3.java).\n\n## Modpacks\n\nFeel free to include Mouse Tweaks in modpacks.\n","published":"2021-03-20T15:55:49.895120Z","updated":"2023-10-01T09:40:10.683782Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":272224,"followers":958,"categories":["storage","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","b1.7.3"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","modloader"],"versions":["RNWLd5dh","VmXwwpoa","ZP9EDGxB","7F7mEY80","Q3YILuAe","EGSuwm1J","q0CGibTg","ILp7UQip","475fj6e8","NanXuqPE","pmMCbsN3","Un7oJEL8","kyT0ersE","Aax1dmTi","5EvmIoqj","dXBVA16v","sjDYaHEo","stb5nE30","m0Dd8Cjy","jBovYAZR"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"Aax1dmTi","project_id":"aC3cM3Vq","author_id":"On32SQVu","featured":false,"name":"[1.19.3] Mouse Tweaks 2.24 Forge","version_number":"1.19.3-2.24-forge","changelog":"- Updated to Minecraft 1.19.3, fixing crash in the Mouse Tweaks configuration menu.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2022-12-21T05:41:18.989806Z","downloads":927,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"8f9aa3a28321711fd368910163fd6ba824923997ca73a93bfef163a02fecaed5aa24d60d183ae30a48b258989660cb5d34569b599978f6f74ef563f329c82ea9","sha1":"91582299dfdbcffda029c2c6f4096c68668daac5"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/Aax1dmTi/MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.19.3-2.24.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.19.3-2.24.jar","primary":true,"size":76053,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha512":"d514658036887841a1811c441a64bf7ea41d55cf54ad1aa1732c2915d6b25ba2d52d67c1ca290e0edf6696099c853ee0eb84acbcc75e4363a60d985ed7df3eaf","sha1":"008a819e9a80fa15387b0fc5e2c97bce126b064a"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/Aax1dmTi/MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.19.3-2.24-api.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.19.3-2.24-api.jar","primary":false,"size":1995,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha512":"2c2fed165963741a4dc0bc34c8299318a10ec86be7edf1a8c203ecd26183cc6d5aecabc3cfe58b96cd8511cf2e9bea4c4690ee8322bb6213f3b8ca74a6b6dbc0","sha1":"ca297007146a5240e4315eeb0d8f662e7d5d49b1"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/Aax1dmTi/MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.19.3-2.24-src.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.19.3-2.24-src.jar","primary":false,"size":19676,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19.3"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Gn6mAc1d","user":{"id":"On32SQVu","username":"YaLTeR","name":"Ivan Molodetskikh","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1794388?v=4","bio":"","created":"2021-03-20T15:35:29.504966Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.19.3-2.24.jar"},"mods\\Janoeo Foundation-8.12.0.90.jar":{"sha512":"380946f242c1cd2c0f12804673dc581091011d59f8aa9af4aaaf2211028ebf2ce97f8b6ca35e9fb64e9184725ba9590ff4e6ca6ef6eec5ecf8eaa27b9ecbc34a","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"B73zMe3t","slug":"janoeo","project_type":"mod","team":"DhS5NVvb","title":"Janoeo Foundation","description":"Base Ores, Nether Ores and More","body":"[![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/Janoeo/Foundation?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/AlasDiablo/JANOEO/blob/master/LICENSE)\n[![discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/630863620842061877?style=for-the-badge)](https://discord.gg/KkzqnzA)\n\n## About Janoeo - Foundation\n\n***Janoeo Foundation*** is the mod who launch the Janoeo Project.

I've bundled them in this mod.\n\nThis mod adds a bunch of optional tweaks to improve the Quality of Life during gameplay. Tweaks can be individually enabled or disabled and configured. Many of the tweaks are disabled by default, so make sure to enable the features you want for the most bestest experience possible.\n\n## Features\n\n### No Offhand Torch With Block\nThis option will refuse to place a torch if you're holding a block in your main hand. Because there's no way you intended to place a torch in that case. Something was just standing in the way of the spot you wanted to place that block in but the torch was fitting since it's smaller. Fixed it for ya.\n\n### No Offhand Torch With Empty Hand\nYou know that feeling when you're tired, try to open the chest but misclicked the block next to it? And of course you still had a torch in your offhand. And of course it placed it. And now you have to break it again. Ugh. This option only allows torches to be placed when your main hand is not empty. This can be enabled additionally to the above.\n\n### Offhand Torch With Tools Only\nThis is the option I consider best, but it changes vanilla behaviour too much to be the default. This will only allow placing torches from the offhand when you're holding a tool. No more accidental torch placement, ever again.\n\n### Do Not Use Last Torch\nThis option is useful when using dynamic lights such as OptiFine. The last torch in your offhand will not be placeable, so you always have a light to carry around with you secured.\n\n### Hide Own Effect Particles\nThis option will make your own potion effect particles a lot less obtrusive for your client. Other players will see them normally. No more annoying particles blocking your view.\n\n### Hide Offhand Item\nWill prevent the item in your offhand from rendering, in case you hate seeing the torch you're carrying on the left. This can be toggled by a keybind too, in case you only hate seeing your offhand item sometimes.\n\n### Hide Shield Unless Holding Weapon\nWill prevent shields from being rendered in your offhand unless you're holding a weapon. Specifically, it needs to be a sword or an axe with an attack damage value greater than 1.5 hearts. No, that wooden stick you're holding isn't a weapon.\n\n### Auto Climb Ladder\nI often make really long ladders down to my mine, and it's a pain having to hold down a key the whole time while climbing back up. With this tweak on, you will continue to climb upwards as long as you look upwards while on a ladder. That means you can type in chat and do other things without instantly falling back down and losing all of your progress on the long journey.\n\n### Disable Potion Shift\nPrevents the inventory from being shifted to the right when potion effects are active. You probably never noticed because NEI did it in 1.7.10 and now Quark does it in 1.10.2 and then there's also a mod called No Potion Shift that does it, but in case you have none of these, you now have this!\n\n### Toggle Off Step Assist\nThere's people who hate step assist, but sometimes those step-assist granting items add some other cool perks that we want. So this option lets you disable the step-assist part only. With optional keybind to toggle.\n\n### Master Volume Slider in Options Screen\nYes, the new volume settings screen is cool. But couldn't you have kept the Master Volume slider on the main settings screen as well? After years of research I have concluded that you can, so I added it back. Saved you a click.\n\n### Music Volume Slider in Options Screen\nMade up user studies have shown that the average player will much more frequently want to turn off the music than change the master volume, so our team of highly experienced quantum programmers have also brought the music slider back to the main settings screen\n\n![](https://blay09.net/files/brand/clienttweaks_settings.png)","published":"2022-06-14T18:20:46.900416Z","updated":"2023-09-27T06:47:04.151958Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":80258,"followers":183,"categories":["game-mechanics","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["T0tustVF","SoUkWRKx","fK62VmwY","IjPL1T1N","Mz7eeTEe","gN1XVFx6","rlQ7mQes","Fhy3pE8g","fxUm9n5z","C46Y48g4","EmDsfaiv","almeE46g","FKfK6YfH","onfW0a04","ofJ9s6y0","iM86WEvk","L3su862e","kiZkKw4d","3zMCvvSv","7Zzx91AW","gUwtFfmz","x2nEWOgf","OranQBcj","uSdTs5qr"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/vPNqo58Q/78a0ae61d366c770fd2c19dab595a045a2d0c106.png"},"version":{"id":"gN1XVFx6","project_id":"vPNqo58Q","author_id":"WE4nCeiO","featured":false,"name":"9.0.0+forge-1.19.3","version_number":"9.0.0+forge-1.19.3","changelog":"- Updated to Minecraft 1.19.3\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2022-12-18T00:16:52.162231Z","downloads":98,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"241132939f64751552cc81e48ede42a2ac68c41448f35b2d5e3dad22c55d44cf801a71682334e9ba31ea436e557a5d23e48b5655b19fe30620f8ce3775b7fab0","sha1":"01f8f7ae9742905c21f7148e33b74c541a2596de"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/vPNqo58Q/versions/gN1XVFx6/clienttweaks-forge-1.19.3-9.0.0.jar","filename":"clienttweaks-forge-1.19.3-9.0.0.jar","primary":true,"size":122466,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"lRKNKP0w","project_id":"MBAkmtvl","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.19.3"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"z3R7bsM3","user":{"id":"WE4nCeiO","username":"BlayTheNinth","name":"BlayTheNinth","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1933180?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-02-28T14:04:06.205061Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"clienttweaks-forge-1.19.3-9.0.0.jar"},"mods\\Towns-and-Towers-1.11-Fabric+Forge.jar":{"sha512":"fd2443dd5003baa67fe36455a1b16ff1f25355bc840947bf7f9b696179a15aaf72474144f6f0fa5a1e53fc3d15650217ce43fa60ead25ee0555b65d1fee20242","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"DjLobEOy","slug":"towns-and-towers","project_type":"mod","team":"PfKGoCzl","title":"Towns and Towers","description":"Spice up your world with new villages, pillager outposts, and even new ships!","body":"<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><font color=\"#FFE16A\" size=\"3\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-style: italic\">\n<center><strong style=\"font-weight: 400\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AS OF RIGHT NOW, TOWNS \nAND TOWERS IS AVAILABLE FOR BOTH FORGE AND FABRIC/QUILT, VERSIONS 1.18.2 AND 1.19.2 RESPECTIVELY.

The structures themselves are a bit \nmore detailed than their vanilla counterparts, but they still fit seamlessly \ninto the world. Not only that but many are inspired by real-life buildings or \narchitectural styles, giving them a fresh new feel. There are over 50 structures \nadded by Towns and Towers so far (as of update 1.9), so have fun exploring! And \nremember, it’s not the destination that’s important, but the journey to get \nthere.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color=\"#FFE16A\">If you wish to see all \nof the structures our mod adds, take a look at our gallery </font>\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/CCZbqMn\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</h3>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><u>Compatibility</u></strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a full list of mods \nthat are currently compatible with Towns and towers, please look\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gE5DvsPwztTtCVi_i6nEOLQM6tm8NU4Q1iCpuqHY2UM/edit\">\nhere</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pack should be \ncompatible with most world generation mods, like Terralith, WWOO, BYG, BoP, \netc., as well as mods that add also add new structures/villages, such as \nRepurposed Structures or ChoiceTheorem's Overhauled Villages. However, some \nfeatures from other mods are not currently present, like the guards from \nVillager Guards mod or certain buildings from Farmer's Delight for example. This \nwill be addressed in the future via a series of datapacks, which will implement \nfeatures from those mods into ours.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 align=\"center\"><strong><u>Frequently Asked Questions</u></strong></h2>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>1.

Just \nnote that sometimes when we update a few things get changed, so there might be a \nbit of console spam. If any serious problems arise because of that, let us know. \nAnd, as always, make backups. Better be safe than sorry.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700\"><strong>2. Is it safe to add \nTowns and Towers to an already existing world?</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yep. Just note that the \nnew structures will only spawn in newly generated chunks.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700\"><strong>3. Is this mod for \nForge or Fabric/Quilt?</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both. We have a \nuniversal version for both (now three?) mod loaders.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>4. How can I locate the new \nstructures?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For 1.18.2: /locate \ntowns_and_towers:[structure_from_list]<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For 1.19+: /locate structure \ntowns_and_towers:[structure_from_list]<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that some structures have the exclusives tag added \nin front. Those structures cannot be located if you only have T&amp;T installed. You \nalso need to have one of the mods that T&amp;T is paired with. For a full list, \nscroll down below (if I remember to add it...).<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>5. Does Towns and Towers modify \nexisting vanilla structures?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As of the latest \nupdate, no. Only new structures are added.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700\"><strong>6. What about the \nloot of these structures?</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The majority of \nstructures use vanilla loot tables for better mod compatibility (see the \nCompatibility section below for more info), but they also use some custom loot \ntables to better integrate said structures into the world. You will still find \npillager outpost loot in pillager outposts, profession chests in villages, as \nwell as bells, workstations, etc., but also new stuff like food, armor, and \nother goodies.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>7. How can I report \nbugs/issues/suggestions?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Write them down below \nin the comments and I’ll try to answer them as soon as possible and as best as \npossible. I’m still relatively new to all of this, so excuse that.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>8. Can I include Towns and Towers \ninto my modpack?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure, but make sure to \ngive credit and a link to our page, and make sure you don't include a modified \nversion of our mod.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>9. 1.16.5???</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTvrv4f3Yho\">\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTvrv4f3Yho</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><u>Credits</u></strong></h2>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Kubek as the original author of Towns and Towers;</li>\n<li>William Wythers, ChoiceTheorem, Apollo, Robified and TelepathicGrunt for \nbeing based;</li>\n<li>Various other creators and their builds for being a massive inspiration \n(check out our Planet Minecraft page\n<a href=\"https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/towns-amp-towers-structure-overhaul/\">\nhere</a> for a full list)</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you find any glitches, bugs or have any \nother suggestions, please let us know.

API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) (Only for Fabric)\n\n## About \n\n\"Load My Resources\" is a client-side mod to automatically load resources like images and sounds on game start.<br>\nIt's like using a resource pack, but it is enabled by default and can't be disabled by the user.<br>\nOn top of that, it's hidden from the resource pack menu, so you don't need to worry about a useless pack entry!\n\n### How to Load Resources\n\nLoading resources is not very difficult, but if you absolutely don't know how resource packs work, please watch a YouTube tutorial first or this will be a bit hard for you.\n\n1. To generate all important directories and files, start the game one time with the mod installed and close it again.\n2. Open the newly generated folder named 'resources' in your '.minecraft' directory. This is the directory the mod will load your resources from.\n3. Copy all resources you want to load to the 'resources' folder. If you want to load resources from a resource pack, copy everything from inside the pack's 'assets' folder to this directory.\n4. Start the game and you will now be able to use the loaded resources in mods and resources from a resource pack will be visible in game.\n\n**Nice To Know:**\nThe `resources` folder is like the `assets` folder in a resource pack. So namespaces work exactly the same as for a normal resource pack.\nFor example: If you put a texture in `resources/mytextures`, the namespace of textures inside the `mytextures` folder will be \"mytextures\".\n\n## Bug Reports and Requests\n\nYou can report bugs and request features either on [GitHub](https://github.com/Keksuccino/Load-My-Resources/issues) or

Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury Injectables](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/78c68766affb70fbd88f9806e0e95f78765ec339448d7102065f2942be2b3215/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e646973636f72646170702e6e65742f6174746163686d656e74732f3538363138363230323738313138383130382f3737363432383831343330393738353632302f756e6b6e6f776e2e706e673f77696474683d31313931266865696768743d343339)\n\n###

They're not meant to be just some houses or dungeons, but new things that feel new and interesting while not being too out of place. The main goal is to make exploration more interesting, rewarding, but also just to enrich the stale Minecraft world.  \n\nStructures are also made to be well adapted to surrounding terrain, to not create superflat-like terrain or ugly cliffs in your world. And on top of that, they're properly integrated and should be compatible with all kinds of mods!  \n\nThis is a data pack packaged as a mod, meaning it is fully server-side. You can install it on vanilla servers and have vanilla clients join.  \n\nI hope you like it! More structures will get added over time.  \n\n### 📦 Content\nFor a list of structures with descriptions see the gallery!  \n\n### 📝 Notes\nPlease also know that this mod is still in development and new versions may differ significantly. I might make any changes, including the removal of structures. While Minecraft can handle this and updating the mod will not corrupt your world, it's still best to make backups.  \n\n### ⚙ Configuration\nIf you want to adjust the frequency of structures to your liking, you can use a custom data pack.

It improves three vanilla biomes: the Nether Wastes, the Crimson Forest, and the Warped Forest. It also adds two new structures: the Crimson and Warped Towers.\n\n### 📦 Content\n\nThe **Nether Wastes** were mainly upgraded with two new features - netherrack spikes (or rather stalagmites and stalactites) as well as blackstone and magma 'lakes'. This transforms the wastes into less of a desert-like biome and more of a hostile cave-like biome.\n\nThe **Crimson Forest** and the **Warped Forest** now include blackstone rocks, fallen fungus stems, and a new, weird type of sprawling huge fungus. The density of vegetation has also slightly been increased.\n\nOn top of that, the forests now also include two new structures - the **Crimson and Warped Towers**. These not only provide loot and mobs, but being very tall (almost a 100 blocks), they can also serve as 'elevators' between the different vertical levels of the Nether!\n\n### 📋 Notes\nThis data pack should be compatible with mods and data packs that change Nether generation, such as *Amplified Nether*. **It is not fully compatible with ones that change the biome files of changed biomes.** The towers should always spawn, though.","published":"2023-06-25T11:50:14.292150Z","updated":"2023-07-01T20:07:28.039487Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"required","downloads":7079,"followers":71,"categories":["adventure","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["datapack","fabric","forge"],"versions":["HwQpiTlb","uLjyZrQk","Gw1iJtgD","7RrKJjqy","CycW6ws6","GzD0PHWn"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/XCIMrYn0/e0349d4c25d734ff921c802ec298a556af3ffc1a.png"},"version":{"id":"uLjyZrQk","project_id":"XCIMrYn0","author_id":"iDSnCeE7","featured":false,"name":"v1.0.0 Mod for 1.19-1.19.3","version_number":"v1.0.0-mc1.19u1.19.3","changelog":"Initial release for the Fabric and Forge mod loaders, versions 1.19-1.19.3","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-25T21:17:02.153065Z","downloads":4936,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"66335ab78031bb5cf4fac905fe0197b6a16740acc994a71a68c389371e06aada2e081d3b2a194bd4bb327526c410aef8e34531e15d3cad91f5548d5f7871fb06","sha1":"7a90243c203c2087ca2e643f9b304f5421a7c24c"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/XCIMrYn0/versions/uLjyZrQk/hearths-v1.0.0-mc1.19u1.19.3.jar","filename":"hearths-v1.0.0-mc1.19u1.19.3.jar","primary":true,"size":210215,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"byrWFkw8","user":{"id":"iDSnCeE7","username":"bebebea_loste","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/117178732?v=4","bio":"I like Minecraft!

Many people complain about bow-wielding mobs being frustrating to fight against. This rework is meant to help mitigate against this notion. Instead of strafing bow-wielders will instead stand still until they fire three shots. After three shots they will move to another position. If the player is too close for comfort then they will also try to find another position.\n\n -Humanoid mobs, such as piglins and zombies, are now able to jump through gaps (credits to the Mobs Attempt Parkour mod for their direct inspiration)\n![parkoah](https://i.imgur.com/wbBHcC3.gif)\n\n# Husks\nHusks will now upon seeing the player burrow for some time and attempt to grab and drag the player down.\nHowever, if a significant amount of damage is dealt while the husk is burrowing it will cancel its attack and do regular melee.\nYou cannot escape the husk while being grabbed but you are allowed to attack it since it has a delay between grabbing and pulling you down.\nGoing on a higher elevation level than the husk will tire it out and also cause it to go into regular melee stance.\n![Husk](https://i.imgur.com/RSUg35t.gif)\n\n# Ocelots\n\nOcelots now attack creepers, parrots, and phantoms to give them some purpose.\n\n# Sheep\n\nSheep now run away from wolves instead of acting like nothing is happening.\n\n# Polar Bears\n\nPolar bears now attack fish.\n \n\n#  Frequently Asked Questions\n\nIs this mod compatible with x?\n\nTry them both and see!

Dungeons will generate foes to keep you away from them... at least until you're ready to walk across countless, dangerous passages...\n\n___Currently generates 30+ unique structures.___\n\n**Requires both Cloth Config API and Fabric API (on Fabric versions)**\n\n## **Screenshots**\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.postimg.cc/7LkKgPFS/2021-08-05-22-47-36.png)![enter image description here](https://i.postimg.cc/VvP95ZwL/2021-07-20-19-50-37.png)![enter image description here](https://i.postimg.cc/bvxL5kWn/2021-07-07-04-17-46.png)![enter image description here](https://i.postimg.cc/qvxV0HHz/2021-07-11-17-10-09.png)![enter image description here](https://i.postimg.cc/zDbsvg1m/2021-07-11-17-13-41.png)\n\n\n","published":"2021-09-18T15:10:39.986884Z","updated":"2023-06-22T22:39:53.740142Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"required","downloads":237083,"followers":445,"categories":["adventure","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["88XWxvai","OGv8ukkd","eZNSKma4","xMeZujmc","isE2BUF0","QYXavI9s","ByhCzmMH","hdhQE5ld","Qtvjt3qS","jSukFXIg","TZo1nfwz","THcw6Yap","wtEUJaeq","uzVTTNfe","v9V9LIbE","tKxOjh70","5EJcAYwV","K99VHylj","SaXz7vvj","8URBsGlT","65GY9WAD","uFLIFUCI","hzihV1uA","GDuhbEYT"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com//data/8DfbfASn/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"5EJcAYwV","project_id":"8DfbfASn","author_id":"JW8OlCkl","featured":false,"name":"When Dungeons Arise 2.1.54-1.19.3","version_number":"2.1.54-1.19.3","changelog":"1.19.3 Port.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-04-18T20:52:21.706013Z","downloads":897,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"23029d1ac07645b35bcf3a1dc26cbdd3a93550c3ee08ac1f2fce993a0ded28d2911aff27a621e555cedc9ae14b6be523852aee5f8f2d025a5e1b2b5a8ba2dfdb","sha1":"b9460edf0bb8022455951e349ab15372c0b55df2"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8DfbfASn/versions/5EJcAYwV/DungeonsArise-1.19.3-2.1.54-beta.jar","filename":"DungeonsArise-1.19.3-2.1.54-beta.jar","primary":true,"size":6679205,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19.3"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"WWPHgngw","user":{"id":"JW8OlCkl","username":"aureljz","name":"Aurel","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74840913?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-07-19T14:56:59.831450Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"DungeonsArise-1.19.3-2.1.54-beta.jar"},"mods\\OfflineSkins-1.19.3-v1.jar":{"sha512":"5357ad489ea8520dee204dff10441531c0d15b06f63f6fbc2aec7536eb30b5bc5370beb66614795355e074b76ec9cac9907e53e4b44b36c12e884d961cf098da","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":"OfflineSkins","description":"made it possible to cache your skins for offline use.\n","authors":[],"version":"${file.jarVersion}","icon":null,"project_type":"mod"},"file_name":"OfflineSkins-1.19.3-v1.jar"},"mods\\charmofundying-forge-6.2.2+1.19.3.jar":{"sha512":"c37897d036d4d12af03fbaaaf82e1dc46272c29dfa56d5e006ccd4c8cf8b444d3ed3a3f4fa538dc02a3c872e7d5771588cd996b77a828f9713ad382bbb8e5cd9","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"b5GyyYkp","slug":"charm-of-undying","project_type":"mod","team":"LBlMxYhc","title":"Charm of Undying","description":"Adds accessory support for the Totem of Undying so you can place it in a slot and don't have to be holding it.

They aren't too common, but exploring big cave systems will give you a good shot at finding some.\n\nSince this is done on top of vanilla fossil generation, fossils will be around ~70% more common in deserts, swamps, and mangrove swamps compared to other biomes. Similarly, fossils are about 160% more common in the deep dark compared to other biomes.\n\n**Configuration:** If you want to edit the generation frequency of these fossils, make a datapack with the `data/more_fossils/worldgen/placed_feature` folder from the source repository and edit the corresponding json file. The `minecraft:rarity_filter` entry controls the rarity of a feature's generation, where a value of 30 corresponds to a 1 in 30 chance of passing through the filter (and a 29 in 30 chance of generation failing).\n\nYou can also go to `data/more_fossils/tags/worldgen/biome` to edit the tags that determine which biomes a fossil can spawn in.","published":"2023-04-25T06:35:41.999832Z","updated":"2023-06-30T17:55:26.807941Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"required","downloads":1313,"followers":34,"categories":["worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["datapack","fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["fpPStwTg","18c35Kqe","UaNcBkSt","s8hj7gua","A1WrIDFm","Jc7SXCzy","7vEN6TXd"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/6wSvZKQk/ba828533e51e79b92a9b53dbd0d234d60f0883db.webp"},"version":{"id":"7vEN6TXd","project_id":"6wSvZKQk","author_id":"gBflFHI3","featured":true,"name":"2.0.0 - Mod","version_number":"2.0.0","changelog":"Updates the mod to use Fabric biome modifiers, allowing it to work on Fabric, Forge, and Quilt.\n\nOn Forge, the 1.0.1 Forge datapack has identical behavior, so you can use either.

The viewer can also apply deobfuscation mappings.\n\nIt works by sampling statistical data about the systems activity, and constructing a call graph based on this data. The call graph is then displayed in an online viewer for further analysis by the user.\n\nThere are two different profiler engines:\n* Native `AsyncGetCallTrace` + `perf_events` - uses [async-profiler](https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler) (*only available on Linux x86_64 systems*)\n* Built-in Java `ThreadMXBean` - an improved version of the popular [WarmRoast profiler](https://github.com/sk89q/WarmRoast) by sk89q.\n\n### ⚡ Memory Inspection\n\nspark includes a number of tools which are useful for diagnosing memory issues with a server.\n\n* **Heap Summary** - take & analyse a basic snapshot of the servers memory\n  * A simple view of the JVM's heap, see memory usage and instance counts for each class\n  * Not intended to be a full replacement of proper memory analysis tools. (see below)\n* **Heap Dump** - take a full (HPROF) snapshot of the servers memory\n  * Dumps (& optionally compresses) a full snapshot of JVM's heap.\n  * This snapshot can then be inspected using conventional analysis tools.\n* **GC Monitoring** - monitor garbage collection activity on the server\n  * Allows the user to relate GC activity to game server hangs, and easily see how long they are taking & how much memory is being free'd.\n  * Observe frequency/duration of young/old generation garbage collections to inform which GC tuning flags to use\n\n### ⚡ Server Health Reporting\n\nspark can report a number of metrics summarising the servers overall health.\n\nThese metrics include:\n\n* **TPS** - ticks per second, to a more accurate degree indicated by the /tps command\n* **Tick Durations** - how long each tick is taking (min, max and average)\n* **CPU Usage** - how much of the CPU is being used by the server process, and by the overall system\n* **Memory Usage** - how much memory is being used by the process\n* **Disk Usage** - how much disk space is free/being used by the system\n\nAs well as providing tick rate averages, spark can also **monitor individual ticks** - sending a report whenever a single tick's duration exceeds a certain threshold. This can be used to identify trends and the nature of performance issues, relative to other system or game events.\n\n## Usage\nTo install, just add the **.jar** file to your mods directory.\n\nInformation about [how to use commands](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/Command-Usage) can be found in the docs.\n\nIf you’d like help analysing a profiling report, or just want to chat, feel free to join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/PAGT2fu).\n\n\n## Guides\nThere are a few small \"guides\" available in the docs, covering the following topics.\n* [The tick loop](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/guides/The-tick-loop)\n* [Finding the cause of lag spikes](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/guides/Finding-lag-spikes)","published":"2021-06-04T13:36:54.735179Z","updated":"2023-09-22T20:36:10.170755Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":211355,"followers":607,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["JdNt7oGW","liwd7pvc","D6L5yWtJ","huGeKmwp","sf2nOVoP","DhT8Y7bB","b3zKGLTS","yysWZODg","eEAJpQea","VkKsarbC","qBdtA5uj","6BEDTXhR","9NSIbttL","JjikdHMk","sYlxF6IX","CWiQ0oM4","xvqXC3WU","X9SnVAPS","jg0K11We","Biivc7P1","g60nhl1v","LVujS26K","6hatB19T","FnKxsd40","mMSAkTm6","3opVno4q","EWTsXhFU","RhyaY2vw","XXMFHMBO","OT1CD9Qj","E5XaSI1N","1K3xO8TS","23U6xkbl","g5rM8xSA","pjW9S4dI","N7JzEApO","1dlOe6ez","XhFbpH8f","VhY9p1RU","GygIHGfW","qyMNf4Pn","oCK984FP","dVHkMOHv","Yp6s4wsw","BeIg1bik","4FXHDE9F","XGW2fviP","h0Z2ObM0","tCU9VuzX"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/l6YH9Als/13676ddae142a85998c1c0086cafc30ce2efde80.png"},"version":{"id":"1dlOe6ez","project_id":"l6YH9Als","author_id":"iRtG8gdL","featured":true,"name":"1.10.37 (Forge 1.19.4)","version_number":"1.10.37-forge","changelog":"This update brings the latest version of spark for Minecraft 1.19.4 to Modrinth.

From sponge-like porous terrain, to stretched alien landscapes, to stacked rounded islands; you'll find new and interesting terrain no matter how far you go.\n__ __\n[![Patron Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786738-7baefaf8-267f-41b6-8ac5-53cc4bd5707e.png \"Join our Patreon!\")](https://www.patreon.com/stardustlabs)\n[![Bisect Hosting Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786219-f87f21d2-fb51-4d78-82df-a16e83fe25c9.png \"Use code STARDUST\")](https://www.bisecthosting.com/stardust)\n","published":"2022-11-23T00:37:43.847598Z","updated":"2023-09-24T19:47:53.764014Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"required","downloads":30837,"followers":328,"categories":["worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["qgcEh2CX","krUi6WMq","qFzFO6Ir","oN3IWKBO","Z04FxO0c","2Oo6cuEV","aDm1dD3Q","uXfroGYN","M1tAEtbt","tM4b5n8e","O0uQyKki","w4mEZnbU"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/LPjGiSO4/b6a7489ca6a0fd553870f9d1c24224d0555232d3.png"},"version":{"id":"Z04FxO0c","project_id":"LPjGiSO4","author_id":"oRXQvVNJ","featured":false,"name":"v1.2.1a ~ 1.19.3","version_number":"1.2.1a","changelog":"Mod-only release.\n\n- Fix module-interference crash when used with Terralith","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-05-30T11:33:13.513677Z","downloads":3528,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"7f24f4d8b0a3c435348a6b4d153bd04d96105a14","sha512":"e0311c800e0e86b49242a6b05303ad64189f0994ec5c8a9e42d1a12472f08c99f7fc281ffd6d44c06a6f746b562f71ad323236f37a2cca1c241bd429e8327567"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/LPjGiSO4/versions/Z04FxO0c/Nullscape_1.19.3_v1.2.1a.jar","filename":"Nullscape_1.19.3_v1.2.1a.jar","primary":true,"size":355223,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"oJIBNZ9Y","user":{"id":"oRXQvVNJ","username":"Stardust","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/oRXQvVNJ/97f7c767b3b6c78eafb51a2e17f04b36da5d294d.jpeg","bio":null,"created":"2022-11-13T21:48:01.983224Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0},{"team_id":"oJIBNZ9Y","user":{"id":"SR8MIsEo","username":"catter1","name":"catter1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63272345?v=4","bio":"Technical Lead for Stardust Labs.

The reason why it's available separately is to keep Xaero's Minimap as light-weight as possible. <strong>This mod is mostly client-sided. Installing it on the server side is optional for some additional features like world identification.</strong></p>\n<p>The mod is still in development! Please report any bugs that you encounter or otherwise they probably won't get fixed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Make sure your world is optimized (<em>Singleplayer - Edit - Optimize World</em>) for the Minecraft version you're playing (repeat after every Minecraft update).

You can create multiple maps on the same server address and switch between them either manually or automatically.</li>\n<li>Works in Singleplayer, Multiplayer and on Realms.</li>\n<li>Intuitive interface. Open the map screen by&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">pressing M</strong>. Move the map around with your mouse and zoom in/out using the&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">mouse wheel</strong>, similar to Google Maps. All relevant controls are listed in a tooltip on the map screen and you can customize a lot of them.</li>\n<li>Optional automatic multiple world detection on servers.</li>\n<li>Displays chunk claims and ally players from the <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/open-parties-and-claims\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Open Parties and Claims</a> mod.

In the waypoint menu, you can see a list of all your map waypoints from the rendered sets, interact with them with the mouse cursor, filter them by name in a text field. The menu also lets you toggle the visibility of disabled waypoints, toggle rendering all sets and change the current waypoint set. Hovering over the waypoints in the menu also acts as hovering over them on the map: they are highlighted on the map and you can use the right-click or hover controls to interact with them.</li>\n<li>An option to export a map as a PNG image file. The mod tries to export the whole map, so it might not work, if the map is millions of blocks in length. I'm planning to give more options for exporting the map in the future!</li>\n<li>Option to limit your map access by binding it to an item required in your hotbar or to be equipped. For example, add&nbsp;<em>mapItemId:minecraft:compass&nbsp;</em>anywhere in the config file to bind it to the compass item. This way the map will not work unless you have the compass in your hotbar or equipped.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-size: 24px; text-decoration: underline;\">Get Xaero's Minimap</span></a></p>\n\n## FAQ\n\n### How do I restore pre 1.30 update Nether maps in multiplayer to be displayed in the \"full\" cave mode type?\n\n<p>First, exit the server and locate the Minecraft game directory that you're using to play on the server. In the game directory, go into&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/Multiplayer_[server_address]/DIM-1/[map_folder]</em>. If such doesn't exist already, create a folder called \"<strong>caves</strong>\", without the quotation marks, and go into it. Inside the caves folder, create a folder called \"<strong>-2147483648</strong>\", without the quotation marks, if such doesn't exist already. Go back into the folder that contains the \"<strong>caves</strong>\" folder and move all \"<strong>.zip</strong>\" files to the&nbsp;<strong><em>caves/-2147483648</em></strong>&nbsp;folder. Feel free to delete the cache folders or also move them with the \"<strong>.zip</strong>\" files.</p>\n\n### How do I set up cave mode to behave like it used to pre 1.30 before cave mode was introduced?\n\n<p>You can fully achieve this only when using the normal version of the minimap or no minimap at all. The fair-play version of the minimap now disables world map cave mode in the Nether and you can't toggle that, so it won't be exactly like it used to be.</p>\n<p>If you have Nether map data from before 1.30, please start by moving it in the correct folder as explained under \"<em>How do I restore pre 1.30 update Nether maps in multiplayer to be displayed in the \"full\" cave mode type?</em>\" on this page.<br />After you're done with that, join a world/server and open the world map settings. Locate \"Default Cave Mode Type\" and set it to OFF and then set \"Legible Cave Maps\" to ON. Next, open the world map screen and click the cave icon in the bottom left of the screen. In the menu that opens, set the \"Cave Mode Top Y\" to absolutely any number. If you are in the overworld, set the \"Cave Mode Type\" to OFF. When you are in the Nether later, set&nbsp;\"Cave Mode Type\" to Full. The cave mode type is stored per dimension, so you can set it to Full for any nether-like dimension and keep it on OFF for anything else. You can also switch between displaying below and above bedrock roof by toggling it.</p>\n\n### Why does right-click teleportation not work for me?\n\nThe mod sends a chat command to teleport you to specific coordinates, which is _/tp @s x y z_ by default, so appropriate permission is necessary. The vanilla /tp command requires OP status (cheats enabled) but it's possible to have separate permissions for commands on a non-vanilla server with certain plugins installed. The used command can be changed in the world map settings with \"Map Teleport Command\". Non-vanilla teleportation commands often don't support the selectors such as @s, so you might have to remove it from the configured command. There is also an option called \"Player Teleport Command\" which is used when you right click tracked players (e.g. your party from Open Parties and Claims). Teleportation to waypoints uses its own setting in the minimap mod. You can read about it on the minimap description page under FAQ.\n\n### How do I discover the map without manually walking?\n\n<p>In singleplayer, the map is loaded directly from the world save. This means that you can pregenerate the world using whatever tools you prefer, relog and use the \"Reload Regions\" option in the world map settings to fix any conflicts in the map cache. In multiplayer, there is no official way to do that. Copying cache from a singleplayer map will not work.</p>\n\n### Why are multiple worlds on the same server address/IP using and writing to the same map?\n\n<p>This mod lets you have multiple maps on the same server address. You can freely switch between maps and create new ones at any time. Map overwriting can be prevented by choosing the right \"Map Selection\" mode for the type of server that you are playing on. Map selection is done in a special menu by clicking the bottom left icon on the world map screen (if the menu isn't open by default). In the menu you can switch between <em>Manual</em>, <em>World Spawn</em> and <em>Single</em> modes and select/create maps by using the top-center dropdown menu. If you hover over the <em>Map Selection</em> option, you can read everything you need to know about each map selection mode, including <em>Server</em> mode. <em>World Spawn </em>mode is the equivalent of what was used by the world map pre 1.6. So you don't have to downgrade the mod to still use it. <em>Server&nbsp;</em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server automatically controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side. If changing the map selection mode switches your map to an empty one, you can always rebind the map that you want to be used by selecting it from the dropdown menu and confirming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Why does the world map ask for confirmation?\n\n<p>A single server address can have multiple overworlds, nethers etc. It can be due to multiple sub-servers or just multiple world saves, for example a \"Lobby\" world and a \"Game\" world. Different worlds don't have any unique identifiers on the client side, which makes it impossible to reliably differentiate between them. Because of this, the world map mod lets you have multiple world maps for each dimension on the same server address. In older mod versions, by default, map selection is <em>Manual</em>, which means that you are asked to confirm which map to use every time you switch dimensions/worlds/sub-servers. You can also choose one of the 2 automatic modes. Map selection is done in a special menu by clicking the bottom left icon on the world map screen (if the menu isn't open by default). In the menu you can switch between <em>Manual</em>, <em>World Spawn</em> and <em>Single</em> modes and select/create maps by using the top-center dropdown menu. If you hover over the <em>Map Selection</em> option, you can read everything you need to know about each map selection mode, including <em>Server</em> mode. <em>World Spawn </em>mode is the equivalent of what was used by the world map pre 1.6. So you <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">don't</span> have to downgrade the mod to still use it. <em>Server&nbsp;</em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server automatically controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side. If changing the map selection mode switches your map to an empty one, you can always rebind the map that you want to be used by selecting it from the dropdown menu and confirming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Why can't I see my minimap waypoints on a server after the installation of the world map?\n\n<p>Your currently confirmed map affects which waypoints sub-world in the minimap mod is considered automatic. This allows each created map to have separate waypoints data. At any point in time, you can select and view any non-automatic waypoints sub-world by going to the waypoints menu (press U) and selecting it from top-right dropdown menu. You can make any sub-world automatic for your currently confirmed map by selecting <em>Options -&gt; Make Sub-World Auto</em>.</p>\n\n### Why has my world map \"reset\" for a specific server?\n\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted. Old world map versions use a world spawn-based system to separate a server into multiple maps. This system often breaks because of servers adding custom functionality to the vanilla compass item by sending fake world spawn coordinates to your game client.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Make sure you update the mod to the latest version.</strong>&nbsp;There are now multiple map selection modes you can choose between,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Manual</em>&nbsp;being the default one. You can now view any world map you have on the current server address. Click the bottom left icon on the world map to open the map selection menu, if it's not open by default. <strong>The top center dropdown menu allows you to select existing or create new world maps.</strong> You can hover over the map selection mode setting (bottom left) to read about how each mode works. <em>Server </em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side.&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Manual</em>&nbsp;mode is the safest alternative and should work on every other server. There are also 2 additional automatic map selection modes when <em>Server</em> mode isn't an option. Read more about them in the tooltip of the setting.</p>\n<p><u><strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">Old map is not in the map menu?&nbsp;</em></strong></u>This can mean 2 things: the server address has changed or the dimension IDs have changed.</p>\n<p>Let's start with the&nbsp;<u><strong class=\"bbc\">dimension ID change</strong></u>. Each dimension on the server has a separate directory in the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">game directory -&gt; XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Please backup the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory before you begin doing anything with it.</strong>&nbsp;In older mod versions, the dimension directory name contains the server address and the dimension key, for example&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/</em><em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1_DIM1</em>. In newer versions the dimension directory is a sub-directory, so something like&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/</em><em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1/DIM1.</em> For compatibility reasons, default&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">overworld, nether and the end</em>&nbsp;dimensions are named&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">null, DIM-1 and DIM1</em>. Other dimensions should have their name be based on the original dimension ID, for example&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1/minecraft$overworld_creative</em>. In 1.16+, you can see your current dimension ID on the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">F3 screen ingame</em>&nbsp;to figure out which directory is meant for which dimension (for example \"minecraft:overworld\").&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Please exit to the game title screen or close the game before editing files/directories.</em><br />Each dimension directory contains sub-directories, one for each map that you have in the dimension (for example&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw$default</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw-4,0,-4</em>) as well as a file named&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">dimension_config.txt&nbsp;</em>that contains the actual display names of the maps. You can use the file to help you find a specific map directory that you want. Moving/copying a map directory between dimension directories should move/copy it between dimensions. You can give it a name later ingame.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">The most common case would be&nbsp;</em></strong>something like moving a map from <strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">/null</em></strong>&nbsp;to <strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">/minecraft$overworld_survival</em></strong>. It is needed when a 1.16+ server starts using a unique dimension ID for each sub-world.</p>\n<p><u><strong class=\"bbc\">For server address changes</strong></u>, you would first have to remove all directories inside&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">game directory -&gt; XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;that contain the new server address. There is usually only 1 such directory if you are using the latest mod version.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Please backup the whole&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory before you do that. Also, exit the game at least to the title screen.&nbsp;</strong>Then you would have to rename each old server address directory (in XaeroWorldMap) to the new address, replacing ONLY the address part.</p>\n<p>Message me or leave a comment if you have questions!</p>\n<p><em class=\"bbc\">Here's the old explanation if you can't update the mod to 1.6.1 or newer:</em></p>\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted (this has never happened as far as I know). It's likely caused by a server plugin changing the behavior of the vanilla compass item and interfering with the mod's \"multiworld\" detection. In most such cases the compass item points to your bed instead of the global spawn point. Sleeping in the right bed again should bring everything back for you if sleeping in another one was the cause of the map \"resetting\".<br />If the map \"reset\" because of a new plugin being added (and if removing it is not an option for you), then here's how you can restore your map (and hope the plugin doesn't do it again):</p>\n<p>Make sure Minecraft is&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">NOT RUNNING</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>1. Go to the game directory</p>\n<p>2. Go to the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory</p>\n<p>3. Find directories that represent the dimensions you have visited on the server. These directories contain the address of the server in their name. The one that ends with&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">_null</em>&nbsp;is the overworld,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">_dim-1</em>&nbsp;is Nether etc.</p>\n<p>4. Open the overworld directory (<em class=\"bbc\">_null</em>).</p>\n<p>5. You should see multiple directories that start with&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw</em>.</p>\n<p>6. Find the one that is the biggest in file size. Copy the name of it somewhere so you don't lose it.</p>\n<p>7. Now find the newest&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw</em>&nbsp;directory (likely the emptiest or just check the creation date). Move this directory somewhere else.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Don't delete it just yet.</strong></p>\n<p>8. Rename the directory from step 6 to the name of the backed up directory from step 7.</p>\n<p>9. Open Minecraft and test if the overworld world map is back.</p>\n<p>10. If it's not, exit Minecraft and restore the old name of the directory that you have renamed + restore the backed up folder. Reread all the steps to make sure you're doing everything right.<br />If overworld is now fixed, proceed to step 11.</p>\n<p>11. Rename and backup the directories with the same names as overworld for every other dimension that you'd like to restore.</p>\n<p><em class=\"bbc\">Contact me if you have questions!</em></p>\n</div>\n\n### Why have my waypoints not restored after restoring the map?\n\n<p>Please read the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">\"Why are my waypoints no longer shown for a specific server?\"</em>&nbsp;section on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">minimap description</a>&nbsp;page.

Many of the available features are targeted at texture generation and manipulation, including, but not limited to:\n\n* Rotating, flipping, and cropping images\n* \"Masking\" images by transferring the alpha channel from one to another\n* Separating out the foreground of an image and placing it on a new background\n* Switching color palettes of an image\n\nMost manipulations are available through the JSON system, which can be utilized by resource packs or mods. The Java API allows this system to be extended further, or used to create the transformations dynamically at runtime.\n\nFor documentation, see the wiki at https://projects.lukebemish.dev/DynamicAssetGenerator/. _**This mod does nothing on its own; you likely want it for use with another mod or resource pack**_","published":"2022-02-06T22:25:36.933760Z","updated":"2023-07-29T03:36:32.958259Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":7146,"followers":26,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["UwInHtnK","9TcaVVia","VyeR13Ul","pd0Geu3p","Tq95WStr","9mVr370i","CC9FFqHc","oXV5YCrk","nsO6f7m5","NfN96NpC","PSUFKrvg","bQaK0ZR8","mZnqCnCM","73rtMDa5","fZ02oIwz","1lSEUa2K","qAqI2FKH","Qy0i0wOt","V9qt9iTO","YheZCBgc","bkHaX0Iu","X4hzLXc4","zoW4iEve","c0lAnzkT","RNUj5Kli","VxZxVOrb","2XdHV4Hn","c5ADQXQg","NYCkTcYf","hw1r9jwP","YlI57iUY","kiA0MBdH","lZBXOSEt","clupv0Gj","PaHYhOff","Dwqk4bs4","xpaae7Df","1w9FdcOy","QxsV3nI9","bYm4QSpd","788tpQoG","M6m3Slbs","B0pZPjA7","rizXlq54","ZdFTJDy8","80wKRnEd","6ZI3xnH5","eIMdEbPN","IiRLMpBg","YCA8JXFR","uUqsEDsh","n7ozEODn","blFdmeJE","5ZDJHeni","FfvTdb01","HxSQxWqB","hFyfdjtk","Ze3RIgnS","JulhGz4S","ZaEjK5KT","N4O8ejSq","vRQUQEdH","L662ZW7p","qGktD7iQ","BG5jWxpR","X30oWVYB","9EHWe8Bn","jxYUybJA","XytQPP9y","nzJicnAh","bbhNiunM","2RoV7FmU","Lo5dk8J4","L0GthGHl","pA2ZPUza","EPCJoxv9","swjTyRcB","IOm2PZNz","P2N7U5Yj","vaNMC2tC","7r3EdX8l","jkbNWOXJ","TDWOJnus","GIAxMj5Q","pI5WSww8","RXHRmavb","9SCkcuaH","OCqA4yEe","4AmH0HfB","NEygr751","iQRiUW0x","fhuk2agH","fGL7Jjnm","iFrHo8hr","VNaLfamp","PgC4tO78","uGbgfwc8","XzbiDdDi","St5ShO3G","ApkECRvM","8J576OET","5F2gmUcs","oWBaKB04","hd8CVBJd","scLeVcNM","5CjVmHZg","phngtMmx","R2bbBkHK"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/83pFEQVb/0bc2284b441841b20eb437a6166f4913bf9cc252.png"},"version":{"id":"7r3EdX8l","project_id":"83pFEQVb","author_id":"QmeAQtym","featured":false,"name":"3.0.2","version_number":"3.0.2","changelog":"## Dynamic Asset Generator 3.0.2\n\n### Fixes\n- no longer errors on uncachable sources\n- Fix build to avoid loom 1.1 issues\n- More cache system changes\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-03-04T22:47:31.886050Z","downloads":49,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"587c2be0c3088cdf2e459703dd33426d314bf7c4b27b247ef2270d42cadf0c4570ee285051fac19554944f975736bfebdab609ddbd85bebefba37e369f8e0120","sha1":"57fff1e6f4fbdad0691fa0b145c1b08c933126f1"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/83pFEQVb/versions/7r3EdX8l/dynamicassetgenerator-forge-1.19.3-3.0.2.jar","filename":"dynamicassetgenerator-forge-1.19.3-3.0.2.jar","primary":true,"size":230156,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19.3"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"U4ucy8hY","user":{"id":"QmeAQtym","username":"lukebemish","name":"","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53243629?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-08-30T20:48:43.939676Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"dynamicassetgenerator-forge-1.19.3-3.0.2.jar"},"mods\\kotlinforforge-4.4.0-all.jar":{"sha512":"9b6cdda46ad9a883a2b75db3cb763fe7a62ce780bf68d0eb66ba153d7d6fa06b0b788f256a0abb802d2e45911952b58c351face0b98e58a8eda2323ffcd84403","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"ordsPcFz","slug":"kotlin-for-forge","project_type":"mod","team":"h8c6AwoX","title":"Kotlin for Forge","description":"Adds a Kotlin language loader and provides some optional utilities.","body":"Used to make mods with the Kotlin programming language.

Many of the spells are based on similar concepts in Fate/Stay Night and other media, but knowledge of these media are not at all necessary to understand and enjoy the mod. \n\n \n\nIn particular, Mahou Tsukai aims for a few general goals, with some exceptions:\n\n* Avoid competing with functionality provided by other mods or vanilla. This means no \"magic bonemeal\" or \"magic flint and steel\". \n* Avoid spells which compete with other spells in the mod. No tiers, no progression (except mana), every spell unique in its own way and with a significant reason to use it. There's no \"growing out\" of spells in Mahou Tsukai - all the spells are useful or fun in some situations, even the most basic ones.\n* No worldgen. (other than a custom dimension - none of the mod is gated behind custom worldgen, so that it can be easily added to existing worlds.)\n \n\nOn top of all this, basically everything in Mahou Tsukai is configurable, from mana costs, to mana regen, to SFX volume, to rendering, to spell sizes/effects, to how often certain spells tick. There's often 5 configs for a single spell, so if you notice something taking too much time, is lagging, is doing something undesirable, there's a very good chance that you can just super nerf it through the config. If you get lost, stop by the discord and ask how. Often, if there's not a config that does the thing you want, I'll just add it if you ask, if I have time.\n\nMore on CurseForge page\n\n","published":"2022-05-16T01:26:55.761068Z","updated":"2023-09-04T23:57:29.847112Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":26185,"followers":47,"categories":["magic"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.12.2","1.15.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["wYw40dPb","VTyEYc8z","CLwD3uSD","2XZThkfm","mJSyAcOt","YONhO2yU","v7WaAN6v","wvRrIQGu","S31vvsdt","IFX4juXB","z4C6jeAt","DbrQFysz","ug5fb6Vy","r9aCjCG7","k3znWhCl","PMUMGSpF","AJnbTCcD","QFqx5Lno","TS1q6FYf","4X7867uy","OnZR4NP8","cZRE8dQk","VDBbxgFq","ngqUiNmW","9P4w7NqC","Ib4dHcOb","9Cs9DFq9","aqqhLbqz","EQNJzcPk","9Vg2GnLb","SA3KKLTM","KShyPQc8","pg2MTu4p","1T8792bh","eUoyJ4xi","nAnVaopd","m64kmrqu","v42mwbDW","mEPCKMdV","W0K3QjOi","331zZRAH","ruHhx0p1"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/7jOxn6qJ/09e9f7ff752b46e7c657bf65024e5a6d7d09cb2b.png"},"version":{"id":"ngqUiNmW","project_id":"7jOxn6qJ","author_id":"Gm14wNpr","featured":false,"name":"Mahou Tsukai 1.19.3-v1.34.42","version_number":"1.19.3-v1.34.42","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-03-09T19:22:19.963299Z","downloads":815,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"20d220007fb37385ab8e9152ad16a8c5baf608b1","sha512":"7951afafa4bedbcfc4943aafd3107907393440e2f7f55430d0911d9b392c784c4886ff5abc235a6891b34109c9408607dc02471c1a39d92905a787a05716e0ba"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/7jOxn6qJ/versions/ngqUiNmW/mahoutsukai-1.19.3-v1.34.42.jar","filename":"mahoutsukai-1.19.3-v1.34.42.jar","primary":true,"size":3963034,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19.3"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"dtXMeVBV","user":{"id":"Gm14wNpr","username":"stepsword","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40430825?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-03-01T01:09:57.804296Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"mahoutsukai-1.19.3-v1.34.42.jar"},"mods\\appleskin-forge-mc1.19-2.4.2.jar":{"sha512":"c564c6772cf42b4d07141baf334a95176b66238c7b500324595e53f1a45cb0e0a181599e3b5a3b3654a7a0d229c3f3a8d88374005cfb89a56264dcc2898309be","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"EsAfCjCV","slug":"appleskin","project_type":"mod","team":"2RI7njA8","title":"AppleSkin","description":"Food/hunger-related HUD improvements","body":"Adds various food-related HUD improvements.

Perhaps if you've not used many resource packs you may not have noticed, but the hotbar has been broken for a long time in Java Edition (<a href=\"https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-67532\">MC-67532</a>). Not only is the selector texture cut off by a couple pixels, but the entire hotbar was actually designed for being raised up off of the bottom of the screen. Restore how it was meant to be and raise it up!</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Raised features some basic adjustability! Either use the keybinds or commands to control the position of the HUD and the chat. See the wiki for more information.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><strong>Raised version 3.x brings about an entirely new way of changing the height of the HUD! Instead of individually altering the height of different HUD elements, Raised now encapsulates where they are called to render to transform the vertical position of their stacks! On the Fabric version, this is done with the various HUD method calls in the main render method and also supports mods that inject at the head and tail of the render method. On the Forge version, this works with the existing render events. Depending on the game version, it can work with RenderGameOverlayEvent, RenderGuiOverlayEvent, OverlayRegistry, and RegisterGuiOverlaysEvent.</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><strong>Every mod that Raised supported before through hacky mixins now works in at least one version of the game, but most work in all! Even some mods that could not be supported before will now work. There are sadly some instances where mods do not work in certain versions, please consult the wiki for more information.</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><strong>Please note that the modular support system attempted in version 2.x will still be supported if you wish to remain with that version. Please see <a href=\"https://github.com/yurisuika/Raised/releases/tag/2.0.0\">the respective releases for version 2.0.0</a> to obtain these support files. Unfortunately, these additional support files are not supported by most launchers.</strong></p>\n<p>If you are a mod creator and find that your mod's HUD is not being raised, fear not because Raised supports Object Share on Fabric! See the wiki or use <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/arrows-info\">Arrows Info</a> for an example.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;</p>\n<p><strong>What does this do?</strong></p>\n<p>It fixes the code that cuts off the selector texture on the bottom.

don't want a broken HUD or want to choose where it is on the screen, then Raised is the mod for you!</p>\n<p><strong>What does it require?</strong></p>\n<p><a

src=\"https://i.imgur.com/8ZhXRQ4.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📖 About:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The <strong>Better Animations Collection</strong> aims to improve the atmosphere of Minecraft by changing the in-game models to allow for better animations and subtle effects. It seeks to give a more realistic feel to parts of the game that can benefit from it, like simulating physics and making model parts move that normally don't.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/8ZhXRQ4.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📚 Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Wiggly Ghast Tentacles</strong> divides ghast tentacles into parts and makes them wiggle realistically, like those tentacle monsters you always see at the movies. Makes them a little more scary, but ultimately nicer to look at.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Squiggly Squid Tentacles</strong> gives a jellyfish-like effect to the swimming animation of squids. Also makes their tentacles flow more while moving.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Playful Doggy</strong> changes wolf tails to be fluffier and flowier, wagging realistically while they stand and run. Also makes tamed wolves lie down instead of sitting. Hold up some meat and they'll roll over, too.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Flowy Ocelot Tail</strong> takes away the stick tails of the current ocelots and gives them something nicer instead. Fully animated flowing tails that move while they stand or run.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Curly Cat Tail</strong> brings those beautiful animated flowing tails ocelots are so proud to have to cats as well. And that's not all; they even curl around their bodies when they sit!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Oinky Pig</strong> adds a very subtle animation, makes a pig's snout move when it oinks. It only moves up and down ever so slightly, but it's there. Just a little bit more life for your livestock. And don't you forget about the floaty ears! Pretty big for such a small animal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Wobbly Cow Udder</strong> makes the udders on cows wobble around when they walk. Also makes their udders have nipples, but if you're sensitive to that kind of thing those can be deactivated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Bucka Bucka Chicken</strong> makes chicken's bills open and close when they cluck. The bill is also a lot more slim, so no more confusing chickens with ducks! And when they strut their heads move back and forth, the wattles under the bill swing around and their wings flap a little. Just like the real deal!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Wiggly Villager Nose</strong> does a subtle change, this makes villagers wiggle their big noses whenever they make their unique \"hmmm\" sound! It's a small change, but who doesn't get a kick out of it?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Wiggly Iron Golem Nose</strong> is exactly the same as above, except for iron golems! Since they don't make any noise the nose wiggles around when they're hurt instead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Jiggly Liquidy Slime</strong> brings a pleasing visual change: This makes the insides of slimes flow around like liquid. They splish-splosh about even more when they jump. The eyes, the mouth, and the core itself all move independently.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Magma Cube Burger</strong> adds a custom death animation to magma cubes, which causes their bodies to form into a pile of steamy, delicious hamburger patties when they die. Unfortunately, you can't eat them because they're way too hot.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Spider Knees</strong> are a truly stunning visual addition. Spiders now finally have the knees they've always dreamed of. Also affects cave spiders.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Wobbly Creeper</strong> wakes some memories of that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2rDbRUDkds\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">very popular music video</span></a> from way back in the day by the one and only <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCshoKvlZGZ20rVgazZp5vnQ\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">CaptainSparklez</span></a>. Remember the really cute wobbly Creeper? Well, it's in the game now. The full thing, the real deal, exactly like the video. Probably the best custom animation in the entire collection.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Arm Flailing Enderman</strong> makes an angry enderman wave its arms around wildly while chasing its target. Suits their twisted nature very well: wacky waving inflatable arm flailing tube endermen!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Animated Snow Man Stick</strong> makes a snowman's arm swing when it throws a snowball.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Kneeling Sheep</strong> is pretty kneat. It makes sheep actually bend down to eat grass. It's no longer just their head lowering, their whole body lowers down to get a sweet sample of that succulent cellulose. Did you notice their KNEES bend, too when they kneel?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Familiar Horse</strong> makes horses more lively again, just like they used to be in older versions. Does this by adding back their mouth and knees while staying true to the vanilla model style.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Spitful Llama</strong> makes llamas open their mouth when spitting. How have they been doing that before?!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Bending Humanoid Knees</strong> makes the knees of zombie-like as well as piglin-like mobs bend when they walk around. Looks pretty fluid and nice. You'll like it, trust me.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/8ZhXRQ4.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷

(v1.1.0+)\n\nThis mod is only required to be installed server side! So clients only need this installed if they want it for single player.\n\n**This alone only works for vanilla (see list above). Other mods may need to implement usage of this mod themselves to make use of the async functionality.**\n\n## Incompatabilities\nMods that affect vanilla's structure locating features may impact Async Locator's functionality.\n\nRight now, the list below states other mods that I'm aware of:\n* [Structure Essentials](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/structure-essentials-forge-fabric)  \nHas been seen that on startup only one of either Async Locator's or Structure Essentials' locating improvements will work. No real issues otherwise, but only one of the mods are required.\n\n\n## Mod Integration\nOther mods can also use Async Locators as a dependency to implement the asynchronous locating into their own code.\nTo do so, please use [CurseMaven](https://www.cursemaven.com/) or [Modrinth Maven](https://docs.modrinth.com/docs/tutorials/maven/) to add this mod to your `build.gradle`, and then make use of the [AsyncLocator class](https://github.com/thebrightspark/AsyncLocator/blob/HEAD/Common/src/main/java/brightspark/asynclocator/AsyncLocator.java) and/or [logic classes](https://github.com/thebrightspark/AsyncLocator/tree/HEAD/Common/src/main/java/brightspark/asynclocator/logic).","published":"2022-12-23T21:26:01.858552Z","updated":"2023-06-24T17:36:55.673321Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"required","downloads":8623,"followers":56,"categories":["library","optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["fQIcdSnk","FMCHAH2s","1LfmLckQ","rnQKMmWz","8vNUDsod","1OyfVjIQ","gHj92xez","ZNlSBszl","SnkyTjlL","Nl3pIq8m","xXhZI4u3","Eip0qUwF","HoBl5dUz","DNCafp7l","PaktOtpC"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/rkN8aqci/47856a081f4eaab4370d7ead5482ea10e3b40fb3.png"},"version":{"id":"ZNlSBszl","project_id":"rkN8aqci","author_id":"24YHDj0T","featured":false,"name":"[Forge 1.19.3] 1.3.0","version_number":"1.19.3-1.3.0","changelog":"- Ported to 1.19.3","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-19T22:29:15.735513Z","downloads":35,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"3c73eb0f47a832fbf036e2d7bc09503e69ed229e","sha512":"604f1a6d92d9c83a22c86f1c704c5c166565af0b910b739a6d965ff2a70b743aaca593c38c18ee3c587a292565ff70f572886934c3713ec227c5efc684f81a3c"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/rkN8aqci/versions/ZNlSBszl/async-locator-forge-1.19.3-1.3.0.jar","filename":"async-locator-forge-1.19.3-1.3.0.jar","primary":true,"size":264791,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19.3"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"dLnIWahV","user":{"id":"24YHDj0T","username":"bright_spark","name":"bright_spark","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11932411?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-31T12:09:06.010982Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"async-locator-forge-1.19.3-1.3.0.jar"},"mods\\riding_partners-1.19.3-1.0.0-forge.jar":{"sha512":"2f9e828d14d543c53e35a99a29588f3c95cd88e5b424dd09fe844372177b4e6fae9283c14b3aaee608c04239d2dccbcbeb92defc602b623ca9d337677a2aee4c","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"FwMGjyuI","slug":"riding-partners","project_type":"mod","team":"gVCPkEIA","title":"Riding Partners","description":"Ride Together, Explore More","body":"<img src=\"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/698970417267867708/1110170858581930055/image.png?width=1920&height=211\">\n\n# Riding Partners Mod\n\nThis mod allows players to team up and ride on the same horse in Minecraft. One player acts as the rider and the other as the passenger. The rider has full control over the horse's movements, while the passenger can sit back and enjoy the ride.

Well, _all parts_.<br>\nAt least in most vanilla menus you can customize basically everything:\n\n- Hide, move and resize vanilla buttons and change their button background textures and labels\n- Add custom buttons to open links, to send messages and _so_ much more\n- Add text elements and change their text color, scale, etc.\n- Add images and GIFs\n- Change the menu background to an image, slideshow, custom cubic panorama or even an animation\n- Play custom background music in menus (set different music tracks per menu!)\n- Use \"loading requirements\" to show/hide menu elements under specific conditions\n- And so, so much more!\n\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/Keksuccino/JustZoom/assets/35544624/d3bc9596-e483-47d9-acec-94552434b1d2\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"384\" /></p>\n\n[**DOWNLOAD CAVE ANIMATION**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/fancymenu-minecraft-cave-animation)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nFancyMenu has a lot of features and I really recommend you to read the [wiki](https://fm.keksuccino.dev) to fully understand it, but there's also a video series about how to use the mod. It's still **very much recommended** to read the wiki, but sometimes watching a video is just more convenient, so here you go:\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\"

**Description**\nThis mod adds various new structures to Minecraft's nether. The final goal is to add more structures that perfectly fit Minecraft worlds. This mod adds multiple buildings that suit the ambience and aesthetics of that biome. This pack will add around 20 unique structures to the game by completion.\nThere will be no backporting beyond 1.19.\n\n<details><summary>FAQs</summary>\nThese are just some of the most asked questions I've had from people, but if you have any more, please leave a comment below and I'll try to help you as best I can.\n\n**1. Is it safe to update Immersive Structure II:Nether edition to a newer version?**\nYes. If any serious problems arise because of that, let me know.\n\n**2. Is it safe to add Immersive Structure II:Nether edition to an already existing world?**\nYep. Just note that the new structures will only spawn in newly generated chunks.\n\n**3. Is this mod for Forge or Fabric/Quilt?**\nAll of them. I have a universal version for three mod loaders.\n\n**4. How can I locate the new structures?**\nFor 1.18.2: /locate imst:[structure_from_list]<br />For 1.19+: /locate structure imst:[structure_from_list]\n\n**5. Does Immersive structures modify existing vanilla structures?**\nNo\n\n**6. How can I report bugs/issues/suggestions?**\nPlease go to my GitHub repo and make an issue there. A discord message will do.\n\n**7. Can I include Immersive Structure II:Nether edition in my modpack?**\nSure, but make sure to give credit and a link to our page.\n\n**8. Can I have Immersive Structure II:Nether edition for 1.x.x, please?**\nSuppose it's lower than 1.19, no. Don't ask this question ever again. The technical limit is too high here.\n\n**9. Can I give Choicetheorem any kind of commission or support?**\nI can't take any commissions or monetary support due to a lack of time and mean to receive payments.\n\n**10. Can I use it on Aternos or any 3rd party downloads?**\nYes, but you can download it via Modrinth, not Curseforge.\n\n**11. Is this server-side or client-side mod?**\nImmersive Structures is a server-side mod.\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Images</summary>\nSome fantastic footage from the mod.\nAll pictures are taken with complementary shaders or complementary reimagined shaders.\n\n</details>\n\n## **Credits**\n+ Vichy0623 for codesigning the builds</span></p>\n\n<details><summary>Compatible mods</summary>\n\n+ Most world generation mods like Terralith, Oh Biome you'll go, Biomes O plenty.\n+ Various structure mods like Town&Tower and Repurposed structures.\n+ Any other structure packs by ChoiceTheorem like ChoiceTheorem's overhauled village.\n</details>","published":"2023-04-30T12:41:32.512342Z","updated":"2023-06-11T09:14:00.220154Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"required","downloads":11156,"followers":52,"categories":["adventure","decoration","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20"],"loaders":["datapack","fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["ZsverLaJ","h6rZCAks","fumkeRgL","1NBeRr6k","tMnaV87R","DQPdL75T"],"icon_url":null},"version":{"id":"1NBeRr6k","project_id":"fECIioDQ","author_id":"srhKvhLi","featured":false,"name":"Immersive Structures II: Nether edition 1.0.0b","version_number":"1.0.0b","changelog":"- Fixing critical fatal bug in forge","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-05-11T09:51:14.279690Z","downloads":9226,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"3f0def2289d3cb0ec8fea931bfeca8fa2e877abd54968e53be14c4b2a51cf56f4e994bec6fc829b09a0200ce2a42fad7d6d83e26ced6113674fb98617cd3df82","sha1":"c6e5d2ed304ee99f3e76a2cd9c4af0865c25e21a"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/fECIioDQ/versions/1NBeRr6k/%5BUniversal%5DImmersive_Structure_Nether_v1.0.0b.jar","filename":"[Universal]Immersive_Structure_Nether_v1.0.0b.jar","primary":true,"size":101011,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"IZADHP3E","user":{"id":"srhKvhLi","username":"ChoiceTheorem","name":"ChoiceTheorem","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/srhKvhLi/04e301eff4942eeaa7c4540eb9d299021e049b58.png","bio":null,"created":"2022-04-29T10:01:27.627748Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"[Universal]Immersive_Structure_Nether_v1.0.0b.jar"},"mods\\bettercombat-forge-1.7.1+1.19.3.jar":{"sha512":"80cb614e0b89703ad130b8d6067a358a6ad1ff646e6bdf6456a8dfe6708a0998fc154fd9bae71970b2ac69d998d28680dd3e39c4bff10b56bc05c490f444884b","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"5sy6g3kz","slug":"better-combat","project_type":"mod","team":"fVvaiaa2","title":"Better Combat","description":"⚔️ Easy, spectacular and fun melee combat system from Minecraft Dungeons.","body":"![Better Combat](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/5sy6g3kz/images/6d65cbe745229c36b7b97cb608926374724d8174.png)\n\n\nEasy, spectacular and fun melee combat system from Minecraft Dungeons.\n------------------\n&zwnj;\n[![Modloader](https://img.shields.io/badge/Loader-Fabric%20|%20Forge-ecebe6?labelColor=263768&style=for-the-badge)](https://fabricmc.net)\n![Availability](https://img.shields.io/badge/Available-1.18.2%20|%201.19%20|%201.19.1%20|%201.19.2%20|%201.19.3-ecebe6?labelColor=263768&style=for-the-badge)\n[![Cloth Config required](https://img.shields.io/badge/Cloth%20Config-REQUIRED-ecebe6?labelColor=263768&style=for-the-badge)](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)\n[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/973561601519149057.svg?label=&logo=discord&logoColor=ffffff&color=7389D8&labelColor=6A7EC2&style=for-the-badge)](https://discord.gg/KN9b3pjFTM)\n\n![slash](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/5sy6g3kz/images/38efa008bc297aa49572761bed1eff2399a1b2dc.gif \"\")\n![stab](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/5sy6g3kz/images/d05e3c914008be42cb89db190ae73f767ca97873.gif \"\")\n![slam](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/5sy6g3kz/images/89422bcaa8fcc18a05834da0b1027b07751e9722.gif \"\")\n\n&zwnj;\n\n# 🗡 Features\n&zwnj;\n### Fancy attack animations\nThis mod includes several one-handed, two-handed and dual wielded attack animation resources.\n### Accurate weapon collision detection\nNo more pixel hunting with your cursor, you can now just swing your weapon and hit whatever is in the way.

However, mods trying to change the same mechanics will never be compatible (such as dual wielding mods).\n\n&zwnj;\n\n## 🤝 Partnerships\n\n&zwnj;\n\nWe partnered up with the following mods, to fully utilise the JSON API of Better Combat:\n\n- [MC Dungeons Weapons](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mcdw)\n\n- [MCDoom](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mcdoom)\n\n- [MedievalWeapons](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/medievalweapons)\n\n- [Mythic Metals](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mythicmetals)\n\n- [Simply Swords](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simply-swords)\n\n- [Spectrum](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/spectrum)","published":"2022-07-04T18:54:33.189896Z","updated":"2023-10-03T17:55:51.927911Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":170423,"followers":728,"categories":["adventure","equipment","library"],"additional_categories":["game-mechanics"],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["3CYKBxen","ZZQdi3pp","S4e1NhvP","vm5jREUS","Hcp3uNRj","sLXa7pZ2","niYMwqqW","E4CYbWvp","9GkOwhi6","BRMMYk8d","KoaUFgOz","1LgYyboz","6JlobxTb","HEmwYD0Y","tsIlqS9N","FxeoNW9K","OrbwS3ba","PuxIMJUv","wRXLFzHT","QPaSohpX","yobLa8Ka","CnXOCzOj","I7g0lYYP","kxeqCjCH","KmpxvsMZ","UheSx89w","eGLGQ4Yk","MEUYYVie","TdFvUGT6","zegHXRXv","WVgEQ9QJ","NjDP73zB","On1e8jtw","y0zoIVe1","98YaFZL7","42LPvr1L","CoyQHb9O","IMIWqP8g","izFZF9kA","930mpjgq","a79fMnbx","xEhkVxqE","bEnzfxLu","K7ndD8PA","eUSBZeXF","zIQw5406","MFZphYTK","A8YxoUuj","LTis9RHk","p8SWuqxf","12NTMIyD","rza9ZYp8","vguKs2Nb","Nke3A2eE","V5vBq3d0","94av95p6","yXT851KE","lbdD31Ny","GtbdDOfI","6DYg9jqE","wTSLGiMF","lYxfimLA","6qfnRKuK","WzOMm40r","afUdG913","JFl05fYS","JhsT2Y4j","swcBOsdJ","k615Hdk1","V1lDVr1G","6HTqAnMI","L77HeQLR","d47dAzGT","rl0yYVw7","XvSy8PJ2","ruf8ut9b","cuvyLYI7","OFm6NkMk","T4rZupi3","hqLjlli1","4ShSUvSm","CkxcDUjA","feKuaHBR","A7doUWQz","NIjIeYjb","atUdkTWG","kEJR3PSs","BQWFvepZ","LihegvCM","kuw5o2Dr","ILTizRUG","QqOP1DU7","PvGH3nY4","arL7c9CT","zrwtpL0K","w9IwMtLV","OhqgJMfy","4w4MQjXp","idsKn7Hx","ITHUgmZn","5fGERlKw","pWDuRxK3","6OURqKIv","syqeTpM4","xCNriqWr","IYrQP8bS","QEmtU3sg","PqiSHyeM","8aZcgAEl","EGyKyHvF","SrGbPUa3","i9M7sKb9","ibYfuIUH","SsDWF33Q","SmUe5knN","PnxjxCao","ikZuTgOU","ur19k9Ub","kSb1Iy26","iU8XokZ7","YKHsErBH","Xb5ZbTnA","UYe5xso7","BVdzLiAa","ZV0EgiSw","WAsPRXZM","d51cgiPN","ukboeB3U","NB5z5KKf","Fzkl8bod","lO4Edvnc","NQcJaV5u","8zYbmr4Z","qIM9327j","MxaoPSMy","WqdF4IBa","8W0DfPzM","cdDnwbqD","T8lEKADG","kq2N9shS","Z6wHaEla"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/5sy6g3kz/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"NB5z5KKf","project_id":"5sy6g3kz","author_id":"CUHgJfv9","featured":false,"name":"1.7.1+1.19.3","version_number":"1.7.1+1.19.3-forge","changelog":"No changelog was specified.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-05-12T20:22:17.773326Z","downloads":484,"version_type":"beta","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"80cb614e0b89703ad130b8d6067a358a6ad1ff646e6bdf6456a8dfe6708a0998fc154fd9bae71970b2ac69d998d28680dd3e39c4bff10b56bc05c490f444884b","sha1":"eeb04c92c39349ebc219ed2412a38ebfc71fe7b2"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/5sy6g3kz/versions/NB5z5KKf/bettercombat-forge-1.7.1%2B1.19.3.jar","filename":"bettercombat-forge-1.7.1+1.19.3.jar","primary":true,"size":904166,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"8AMPotFw","project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"gedNE4y2","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.19.3"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"fVvaiaa2","user":{"id":"CUHgJfv9","username":"ZsoltMolnarrr","name":"Molnár Zsolt","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4989469?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-07-04T18:48:27.207892Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"bettercombat-forge-1.7.1+1.19.3.jar"},"mods\\calmmornings-1.19.3-2.0.2.jar":{"sha512":"ba41c101d38140044dd07533cd54946113484185b928d60ea35c3d4a6c7cbab482dd21fce59d0eb3ee760b71d964319387470004398db78d52a36c032b7dff7e","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":"Calm Mornings","description":"Despawns hostile entities in a configurable radius around the player upon waking.

1.18.2+\n\n![Github License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/AbdElAziz333/SmoothBoot-Reloaded)\n![Github Issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/AbdElAziz333/SmoothBoot-Reloaded)\n[![This is a Fork](https://img.shields.io/badge/This%20is%20port-Support%20the%20original-orange)](https://github.com/UltimateBoomer/mc-smoothboot)\n\nSmooth Boot (Reloaded) is a optimization mod and unofficial fork of Smooth Boot for Minecraft Forge 1.18.2+, If you have a PC with a older or lower end CPU (ex. CPUs with 8 or less threads), you may have noticed that Minecraft takes up 100% of the CPU when loading into the title screen, causing cursor stutter and makes multitasking painfully difficult. Smooth Boot (Reloaded) solves this problem completely, and loading should be much smoother and potentially faster as well.\n\n### Features\n\nChange amount of threads used for loading\nChange priority of threads used by Minecraft\n\n### How the mod works\n\nMinecraft uses executors to run multithreaded tasks. The problem is that the tasks that are ran during loading are quite heavy on the CPU, so it leads to 100% CPU usage. And, some of the tasks do not necessarily benefit from multithreading. Smooth Boot fixes these problems by change the parameters of the executors, including the number of threads they use and the priority of each thread.\n\nFor more information, please read the [Smooth Boot (Reloaded) wiki](https://github.com/AbdElAziz333/SmoothBoot-Reloaded/wiki).\n\n### Modpack Permissions\n\nSmooth Boot (Reloaded) is a free and open-source project on Modrinth, and as such-- of course you can include it in your modpack!\n\n### Issues and Feature Requests\n\nPlease use the issue tracker linked at the bottom of the page to report bugs, crashes, and if you want to propose new features or otherwise contribute to the mod, i will gladly accept pull requests, as well!\n\nIf you want to support me, use my code **AbdElAziz333** to get 25% off your first month and enjoy playing

[Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu) is optional in case you want more configuration like enabling case sensitivity and changing the filtering mode.\n\n## Improved filtering\n\n- Vanilla usually starts comparing the input with the start of the suggestion candidate and discards if it doesn't match. In some cases it checks for a `.` or `_` and then the input. This can often be annoying when trying to search for something because it is too strict. This mod changes that, so now you have a choice between different filtering modes:\n  - `STRICT` - the vanilla way\n  - `SLIGHTLY LOOSE` - shows all suggestions containing the input anywhere inside\n  - `LOOSE` - like the previous but with multiple words, separated by an underscore\n  - `VERY LOOSE` - shows all suggestions containing every letter in the input\n\n\n- Suggestions with a specific prefix can be hidden. That applies to both directory and file names. For example, if the specific prefix is an underscore, an identifier named `datapack:_function` will be hidden and so will be `datapack:_directory/function` but `datapack:directory/function` won't be. It works for all identifiers, not just functions. This feature is disabled by default.\n\n## Improved sorting\n\nSuggestions are sorted from the strictest to most loose match. Vanilla only sorts alphabetically, lacking multiple filtering modes.\n\n## Server and client\n\nSuggestions can be separated into two groups:\n1. ones that are filtered on the server(based on the client's input);\n    - e.g. functions, loot tables, item modifiers, predicates, and a few others\n2. ones that are filtered on the client.\n    - e.g. scoreboard criteria, colors, blocks, and others\n\nSince the first group's filtering is controlled by the server, a special workaround is established to let the client use the new way of filtering suggestions, independent of the server. Therefore, this mod is also a server mod and provides better suggestions even for clients without the mod.\n\n## Examples\n\nTop - vanilla, bottom - Suggestion Tweaker.\n\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31567122/163831589-613e5483-f946-4afa-b8a7-069d714d9943.png\" width=\"512\">\n<br/>\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31567122/163831940-3ea6063e-1adc-494c-b3cc-91f358331c7f.png\" width=\"512\">\n<br/>\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31567122/163832068-dca72913-b8bb-4cda-b827-ae49fd43beba.png\" width=\"512\">\n\n## Idea\n\nCredit goes to SnaveSutit for the cool idea!","published":"2022-04-18T18:34:18.870775Z","updated":"2023-08-30T22:38:49.176002Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":11564,"followers":132,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["7ibJmhXj","Vvxij2Ev","6uD7cugc","6rVJCfOK","ellmLzvg","qJKtlZ5Z","NF7NeBD4","8BJTnrdg","LY5yBEJy","kgF1KR0Q","MpxmTxJW","yx4Rkjaf","1hT4LwC5","wDQ6ZnZY","gtC7W7w2","fseCNrGd","P4N5ckiy","rcntiesv","jLiLhHJX","O1jb0GZM","AHSFKQhZ","lD7jzJGF","iCjav34s","AbdvRnZx","jUEV9Wmi","Lma1yzSs","gIueoFxn","8XPZx1AX","pIuw2Ji8","R0Ctw19S","R7E8A3ix","JMSu2F7u","LCHjGGRM","LfXM5ByD","qq5DMRU2","RJeuHy76","lWhRwRPO"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/MBLj38R0/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"qq5DMRU2","project_id":"MBLj38R0","author_id":"igjVKK0f","featured":false,"name":"[Forge 1.19.x] v1.19.1-1.5.1","version_number":"1.19.1-1.5.1+forge","changelog":"- Fix #7\n- Recommend the Better Suggestions mod","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-08-30T22:29:20.631911Z","downloads":29,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"4ffcdb600e32cdf933fb6c86eb6a1d42cf569a98","sha512":"dc21402f7cfa1c78e6f364a76494b415a1a030aac52587b02b7709ba6174527683cbf9aa4c947e8b1ec8321e1fc39a19d584183dc5d21976d2891dc55dc93d18"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/MBLj38R0/versions/qq5DMRU2/suggestion-tweaker-1.19.1-1.5.1-forge.jar","filename":"suggestion-tweaker-1.19.1-1.5.1-forge.jar","primary":true,"size":25502,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Q2TUDbHV","user":{"id":"igjVKK0f","username":"velizarbg","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31567122?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-12-30T19:57:49.463547Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"suggestion-tweaker-1.19.1-1.5.1-forge.jar"},"mods\\player-animation-lib-forge-1.0.2+1.19.3.jar":{"sha512":"be63b05406c3882cf17dfcfcf7a1909d52b937daf3a3dfc2f9fd1cd79269e9cce1ad0cc64b9b7285bb817671141629ceb8121181cf96f7d575fbd9b57f89a820","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"gedNE4y2","slug":"playeranimator","project_type":"mod","team":"f913Xl1r","title":"playerAnimator","description":"animate the player","body":"# Player animation library,  \n## animate the player using keyframes.\n\n\nFor users/modpack devs, just put the jar into the mods folder.  \n\nFor mod developers, you may find more details [here -

This mod aims to optimize the general performance of Minecraft(mob ai, game physics, chunk loading, etc..) without changing any behavior. It works **on both the client and server**, and can be installed on servers **without requiring clients to also have the mod**. With the mod installed, you can see on average a **45% improvement to server tick times**, resulting in a much leaner game.\n\nEven in single-player, your game runs an \"integrated server\" which ticks the world your player is in. Through optimizing the server-side of the game, this can free up your computer's processor to focus on other tasks, resulting in **improved frame rates and responsiveness**. For multiplayer servers, administrators can expect a sizeable improvement to tick times, allowing their hardware to support more loaded entities, chunks, and players.\n\n*(Note: Canary is stable at this point but also --issues are expected, also as mentioned above Canary is unofficial fork that means it has not been created by CaffeineMC team. So please report any issues you have to me only from here.*\n\n### Installation\n\nCanary only supports Minecraft Forge 1.18.2 and up, So make sure you have the latest version of Forge present and simply drop the mod into your mods folder, no other mods or additional setup is required!\n\n### Features\n\nCanary contains all the optimizations of Lithium, You might be curious by now as to what exactly Canary is doing in order to achieve such significant gains, and I'm happy you are! You can read about (some) of the changes below.\n\n**Physics optimizations:** Entity collision detection has seen significant improvements through reducing the collision resolution complexity for simple, cuboid blocks. A more accurate algorithm is also used to reduce the number of blocks being checked every tick, especially in cases where entities are moving very quickly.\n\n**Mob AI optimizations:** We make use of an event-based system for some tasks in order to reduce the CPU usage incurred by constantly polling the world for changes. Mob \"brains\" have also been optimized to select between different AI tasks much, much quicker than before. Comparison before and after here.\n\n**World generation optimizations:** Many calculations in vanilla's world generation are unnecessary and do not affect the final result, which gives ample opportunity for Canary to optimize this overhead away.\n\n**Chunk loading optimizations:** The temporary data structures used in block palette compaction have been changed to be much more efficient. This results in fewer TPS drops while players are exploring terrain and provides a modest boost to world load times. We also batch some verification operations to reduce unnecessary disk I/O.\n\n**Mob farm optimizations:** Mob cramming is significantly less expensive as resolving collisions between entities has been optimized to take advantage of the fact that simple boxes are involved. This makes mob farms considerably less harmful for server tick rates.\n\n**Block ticking optimizations**: has less overhead, making things such as block update settling after generating chunks and other Redstone contraptions faster. This also reduces the amount of time it takes for a block to determine if it is ticking by schedule from O(n), where n is the number of ticking blocks, to O(1), providing a significant speedup when many blocks are being ticked.\n\n**Explosion optimizations:** Many optimizations have been applied to TNT and explosions alike, reducing their associated lag without changing how they behave. In particular, ray-tracing is optimized to take advantage of the fact that multiple steps through a way will occur in the same block position, allowing us to quickly re-use the previous step's results. We also make use of a faster position tracking algorithm which avoids many excessive allocations.\n\n**Point of Interest optimizations:** Complex mob AIs in Minecraft, primarily those belonging to Villagers and Pillagers, often need to find relevant points of interest in the world in order to choose the most appropriate AI task. In vanilla, querying all points within a chunk requires 16 separate retrievals through stream-heavy code. With Canary present, this task is reduced to a single simple retrieval that makes use of a much faster (and traditional) iterator based approach, yielding anywhere from a 16-22x improvement for queries.\n\n**Data Tracker optimizations:** The internal data manager used for tracking some entity state and properties has been optimized to use flat arrays and avoid expensive locking, providing a decent boost whenever these attributes are accessed during a game tick.\n\n**Redstone Wire optimizations:** Calculating the new power level of redstone wire after a block update is costly. Reducing the number of blockstate checks without any change in behavior reduces redstone dust lag by about 35%.\n\n... And other internal improvements to help the JVM better optimize code.\n \n### Configuration\n\nMuch like Lithium, Canary makes use of an unusual configuration system which can be used to enable or disable certain patches.

Even after the enchanting screen is closed! To put this new capability to good use, enchanting tables will <strong>Render Their Contents</strong> in the world. There are two different rendering modes to choose from.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Rerolling Enchantments</strong> has become extremely easy. The enchanting screen now has a dedicated button to do just that at a small cost of some lapis lazuli and a few experience points (not full enchantment levels to not ruin your level progress for enchanting as much). Costs are fully configurable and can even be set to completely free.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Enchanting tooltips will show not just a single random enchantment, instead they show the <strong>Complete Outcome</strong> of the enchanting process. This feature is disabled by default.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Additionally, to enable some basic automation, <strong>Hoppers</strong> can be used to input and output items in the following ways.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Top:</strong> Input for enchantable items</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Sides:</strong> Input for lapis lazuli</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Bottom:</strong> Output for enchanted items</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">And <strong>Comparators</strong> work, too! They will output a signal strength of 0, 1, 2, or 3 depending on the amount of lapis lazuli items placed in the table.

Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Where can I download this mod for Fabric on versions of Minecraft before 1.19?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Older downloads are found on the <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/easy-magic-fabric\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>old project page</strong></span></a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I just installed Easy Magic and it's not working!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> No new capabilities will be added to existing enchanting tables. You will need to manually break and replace the block. Same goes for converting enchanting tables back to vanilla after removing the mod.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: The new button for rerolling enchantments added to the enchanting screen is incompatible with my resource pack!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> The client config has an option to keep the book from the vanilla screen, the rerolling button will simply not be visible then. Rerolling still works as before, just by clicking the book now.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I want anvils to keep and render their contents as well!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Sure thing, check out my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/easy-anvils\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Easy Anvils</span></a> mod which does just that and more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I'm using Apotheosis' or Quark's enchanting system, will Easy Magic work as well?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Sadly no, Easy Magic only supports the vanilla system and will be overridden by other mods introducing their own.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/OwxZhGM.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\"

As a result, they have closed the performance gap, obsoleting Starlight on the client side.\n\nCompatibility\n------------------\nStarlight can be installed either on the dedicated server or client. It is _not_ required to be installed on both sides.\nIf you have Starlight on the server, clients can use Vanilla/Phosphor/Starlight to connect. Likewise, if you have Starlight on \nthe client, you can connect to Vanilla/Phosphor/Starlight servers.\n\nStarlight cannot be installed _with_ Phosphor, they are completely incompatible. \nBrowsing through [Starlight's Issue Tracker](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/issues \"Starlight's Issue Tracker\") will show\nfurther mod incompatibilities. Starlight is a rather destructive light engine rewrite, so it should be \nexpected to break mods more often.\n\nPurpose\n------------------\nStarlight was developed for higher scale dedicated servers, as they suffered performance problems due to how ungodly slow the\nlight engine was. The only solution was to create an extremely invasive mod which rewrote the entire light engine.\nI ported the mod to fabric so that I can update it during snapshots, and decided that publishing it for \nall users, especially client users, would be beneficial. However, it does have the downside of being an invasive mod:\nBeing invasive didn't affect higher scale servers because they run on Bukkit.\n\nFurther reading on the technical details of how Starlight achieves its performance \ncan be read here: [TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/blob/fabric/TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md \"TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md\")\n\nPerformance for 1.20:\n------------------\nHere are a few graphs showing performance in 2 areas on: Block editing at high y-levels, and normal block light updates:\n\n~~Light engine time chunk generation Graph~~ has been removed as a benchmark as it is invalid for 1.20.

All leaves are gone after about one second (configurable).

Aren't there like a dozen already?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Sure, but this one is different for sure.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Out Of The Box Mod Compat:</strong> All mods that register their leaves in the <code>minecraft:leaves</code> tag are automatically supported, even when their leaves don't extend vanilla Minecraft's leaves block (e.g. some of the large trees in the <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/terrestria\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Terrestria</span></a> mod by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/coderbot\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">coderbot</span></a>).</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>No Additional Block Updates/Block State Checks:</strong> Leaves Be Gone is extremely efficient when determining which leaves blocks to accelerate decay for. It hooks in just where vanilla decides when a leaves block is able to decay, so it doesn't have to do any calculations on it's own. Also no additional calculations are made elsewhere, like when harvesting logs or when other leaves blocks decay as in other mods.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Works Properly Across Chunk/Level Reloads:</strong> Scheduled leaf decays are stored using Minecraft's native system for scheduling ticks (no custom hacky solution required!), so when undloading and reloading the area leaf decay continues as it should without having to repeat any calculations.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9bnOur2.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷 Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/504/813/2022-10-06_11.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/504/814/2022-10-06_11.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Redwood tree leaves be gone!</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>So many drops!</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9bnOur2.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>💡 FAQ:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Mods can have three different kinds of configs depending on the kind of settings they provide: <strong>Client</strong>, <strong>Common</strong>, and <strong>Server</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Client</strong> and <strong>Common</strong> configs are found in <code>/.minecraft/config/</code>, named as <code>&lt;modId&gt;-client.toml</code> and <code>&lt;modId&gt;-common.toml</code>, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Server</strong> configs though are applied per world, therefore you'll find those in <code>/.minecraft/saves/&lt;world&gt;/serverconfig/&lt;modId&gt;-server.toml</code> for local singeplayer worlds, and in <code>/&lt;world&gt;/serverconfig/&lt;modId&gt;-server.toml</code> for you Minecraft server. Changes made to a server config only apply to that one world. Setting default values in server configs for all <strong>newly</strong> created worlds is possible by copying the modified server config to <code>/.minecraft/defaultconfigs/</code>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In a local singleplayer world you can quickly find config files by running the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command and by choosing <code>CLIENT</code>, <code>COMMON</code> or <code>SERVER</code>. Then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to open the file in a text editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">On some mod loaders editing configs is also supported in-game via the <strong>Mods</strong> menu option. On some Minecraft versions you can also install my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod for editing configs directly in-game.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9bnOur2.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;

No more!</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">At a time where there's a lot of mods and even more items, you'll need functional and capable backpack. Since the traveler's backpack can provide about <strong>45 inventory slots</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>2 fluid tanks</strong>, which each can store up to 4 buckets of fluid or even 16 bottles of potion&nbsp;(Now even more, since it's configurable!), this backpack becomes a really good option to consider. All inventory slots and tanks can be accessed via external pipes. The backpack also provides special buttons - <strong>sort</strong>, <strong>quick stack</strong> and <strong>transfer</strong> to seamlessly manage inventory!</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Chestplate or backpack? Why not both? (Now with Curios integration! 1.16+)</span></span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Traveler's backpack doesn't need any empty armor slot (or other slot, unless Curios integration is enabled) to be worn. Player can wear one backpack on his back at the time and it's inventory can be accessed via <strong>B</strong> (Configurable) button.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>The best gear for adventures!</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here comes the Traveler's Backpack! You are able to use crafting inside of backpack's inventory or pull out the sleeping bag in any time you want! Don't worry, you won't lose your spawn point! Also worth taking advantage of handy tool slots (Tool swapping described below), which render directly on backpack. Fluid tanks in combination with Hose Item (Hose functioning described below) are good portable fluid storage.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/UkVUU6N.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1903\" height=\"723\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Customization that you have never seen!</span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Choose your personal style from over 45 custom backpacks, which represent various creatures and blocks. As if that weren't enough, some of them can provide special abilities! All backpacks' textures have been remade one by one to fit new Minecraft style. 1.16+ versions provide <strong>dyed backpack</strong>. You can combine whichever dyes you want!&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/6nzBlK2.png\" width=\"1123\" height=\"1009\" /></p>\n<hr />\n<h1><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Inventory guide</span></h1>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Traveler's backpack inventory can be split into segments, which have different functions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Here you can see the inventory:</span></p>\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/inwSgPA.gif\" width=\"900\" height=\"963\" /></p>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><strong>Blue slots&nbsp;</strong></span>stand for base backpack inventory, where you can store your items.</li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Green slots&nbsp;</strong></span>accept only tools and provide special inventory action - Tool cycle (See below)</li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #993300;\"><strong>Brown slots</strong>&nbsp;</span>are mostly crafting grid and one of them is crafting result slot.

Tank is selected if its border is white, this also means that hose is active. Hose attachment resets everytime when you take off your backpack or remove hose from inventory, so make sure that any of the tanks is selected. There are 3 hose modes, which I'll describe below:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Suck Mode</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can pick up the fluid from the world or - <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">if clicked on suitable tank</span> - transfer fluid from clicked tank to your backpack's tank.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Spill Mode</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">You can spill the fluid into the world or - <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">if clicked on suitable tank</span> - transfer fluid from your backpack's tank to clicked tank.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Drink Mode</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Allows player to drink some tank's contents - <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">not all fluids are drinkable</span>, some of them may give special effects though.</p>\n<p><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Additional Tips</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Swap tank attached to hose</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you wear a backpack and hold hose, click <strong>N</strong> to swap tank which hose is attached to. (Configurable in controls)</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Change hose</strong><strong> mode</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you hold hose, hold <strong>Z </strong>(Configurable in controls) and <strong>scroll up or down </strong>(can be set to use keybind only in config)&nbsp;to change active hose mode.</p>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong><b>Swap tool</b></strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">You can perform this action if you're holding a tool, wearing a backpack and at least one tool slot isn't empty in backpack's inventory. At first hold&nbsp;<strong>Z</strong> (Configurable), then scroll up or down (Can be set to use keybind only in config). It will replace your current tool with one from tool slot. Such a useful trick!</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Open inventory</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">If you wear a backpack, click <strong>B</strong> to open inventory.

YUNG's Better Desert Temples redesigns vanilla desert temples to be way more exciting, adding a variety of new puzzles, traps, &amp; parkour challenges. And of course, you'll get much better loot than vanilla's desert temples for your troubles!\n</p>\n<p>\nBy default, mining fatigue will be applied to all players in the Better Desert Temple. Once you clear the temple (i.e. kill the pharaoh at the end of the temple), the mining fatigue effect for that temple will be permanently lifted! You can disable this feature in the config. Additionally, you can re-enable vanilla desert temples to spawn alongside Better Desert Temples in the config.\n</p>\n<p>\nCloser look: <br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TpkTeTeDKJo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnimated trailer: <br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1C5Z0DaOQk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/JR6R3uf.png\" alt=\"Compatibility\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nYUNG's Better Desert Temples is intended to be fully compatible with every worldgen mod, including:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Mineshafts\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-mineshafts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Mineshafts</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Strongholds\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-strongholds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Strongholds</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Dungeons\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-dungeons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Dungeons</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Extras\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-extras\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Extras</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Bridges\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-bridges\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Bridges</a></li>\n<li>Repurposed Structures.

The final goal is to add more structures that perfectly fit Minecraft worlds. This mod adds multiple buildings that suit the ambience and aesthetics of that biome. This pack will add around 30 unique structures to the game by completion.\nThere will be no backporting beyond 1.19 for the mod version and 1.18.2 for the datapack version.\n\n<details><summary>FAQs</summary>\nThese are just some of the most asked questions I've had from people, but if you have any more, please leave a comment below and I'll try to help you as best I can.\n\n**1. Is it safe to update Immersive structures to a newer version?**\nYes. If any serious problems arise because of that, let me know.\n\n**2. Is it safe to add Immersive structures to an already existing world?**\nYep. Just note that the new structures will only spawn in newly generated chunks.\n\n**3. Is this mod for Forge or Fabric/Quilt?**\nAll of them. I have a universal version for three mod loaders.\n\n**4. How can I locate the new structures?**\nFor 1.18.2: /locate imst:[structure_from_list]<br />For 1.19+: /locate structure imst:[structure_from_list]\n\n**5. Does Immersive structures modify existing vanilla structures?**\nNo\n\n**6. How can I report bugs/issues/suggestions?**\nPlease go to my GitHub repo and make an issue there. A discord message will do.\n\n**7. Can I include Immersive structures in my modpack?**\nSure, but make sure to give credit and a link to our page.\n\n**8. Can I have Immersive structures for 1.x.x, please?**\nSuppose it's lower than 1.19, no. Don't ask this question ever again. The technical limit is too high here.\n\n**10.

contains all the features of the classic Sodium.\n<details>\n  <summary>Features</summary>\n  \n- A modern OpenGL rendering pipeline for chunk rendering that takes advantage of multi-draw techniques, allowing for a significant reduction in CPU overhead (~90%) when rendering the world. This can make a huge difference to frame rates for most computers that are not bottle-necked by the GPU or other components. Even if your GPU can't keep up, you'll experience much more stable frame times thanks to the CPU being able to work on other rendering tasks while it waits.\n- Vertex data for rendered chunks is made much more compact, allowing for video memory and bandwidth requirements to be cut by almost 40%.\nNearby block updates now take advantage of multi-threading, greatly reducing lag spikes caused by chunks needing to be updated.\n- Chunk faces which are not visible (or facing away from the camera) are culled very early in the rendering process, eliminating a ton of geometry that would have to be processed on the GPU only to be immediately discarded. For integrated GPUs, this can greatly reduce memory bandwidth requirements and provide a modest speedup even when GPU-bound.\n- Plentiful optimizations for chunk loading and block rendering, making chunk loading significantly faster and less damaging to frame rates.\n- Many optimizations for vertex building and matrix transformations, speeding up block entity, mob, and item rendering significantly for when you get carried away placing too many chests in one room.\n- Many improvements to how the game manages memory and allocates objects, which in turn reduces memory consumption and lag spikes caused by garbage collector activity.\n- Many graphical fixes for smooth lighting effects, making the game run better while still applying a healthy amount of optimization.\n- Smooth lighting for fluids and other special blocks.\n- Smooth biome blending for blocks and fluids, providing greatly improved graphical quality that is significantly less computationally intensive.\n- Animated textures which are not visible in the world are not updated, speeding up texture updating on most hardware (especially AMD cards.)\n  \n</details>","published":"2022-07-02T09:36:53.033379Z","updated":"2023-09-24T21:04:19.380872Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":229242,"followers":269,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["52gcrxOy","suKMGRbi","V7JZgyIU","TnN4CV2Q","c4RHSmo9","WTmxKPaw","ibGbqBbP","w6asrex4","JEoSJNGo","v1Byy3O4","qSw3a67v","ySmWhbfP","QrS8ZpUH","lCbMhmSa","Hlexif59","uqcWRM8W","9DCa1IzX","6YKudvQ5","vkRZleVy","iLEHOlRR","17IcFh9q","KoZMxzwB","YDAuLUY8","bmmEZ4mh","VKligEsm"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4ZqxOvjD/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"ySmWhbfP","project_id":"4ZqxOvjD","author_id":"OGBzw79h","featured":false,"name":"Rubidium mc1.19.3-0.6.3","version_number":"0.6.3","changelog":"Updated to 1.19.3\n\nFixed ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException (thanks to FTB and Sodium teams)\n\nAdded Optimized Bamboo option\n\nFix checking if adjacent side is solid using wrong position (thanks to pupnewfster)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2022-12-12T10:09:34.901146Z","downloads":3654,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"19aad0bbe61389c99b1e497ab9bcf9b47ac15898c4acc2a47defa833759bafdf04b1741c474bef57956a3cb9b7269243a3c643ededdf3b8a04c511759f72df56","sha1":"26d02d030a0d4237382d42dde254f57be3719099"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4ZqxOvjD/versions/ySmWhbfP/rubidium-0.6.3.jar","filename":"rubidium-0.6.3.jar","primary":true,"size":619719,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19.3"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"CsqDoH4a","user":{"id":"OGBzw79h","username":"Asek3","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64613894?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-07-02T09:26:04.535310Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"rubidium-0.6.3.jar"},"mods\\curios-forge-1.19.3-5.1.4.1.jar":{"sha512":"3625c41e5cc67baf9ca38b3e0a07a39db2f49fe437c2d44865e5daec9bf9185699f56c038ecff681e4153f0ae780f0e60493cd2d4b4361f4bf7e9f681ef309a2","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"vvuO3ImH","slug":"curios","project_type":"mod","team":"JCm9vxVF","title":"Curios API","description":"A flexible and expandable accessory/equipment API for users and developers.","body":"Curios is a flexible and expandable accessory/equipment API for users and developers. The purpose is to provide functionality for developers to add extra accessory/equipment slots in a convenient and compatible manner, as well as to give users the ability to configure these slots to their preferences. By default, Curios does not add any content except for an inventory GUI. There are no slots and only two items, the latter only being available through the Creative menu and primarily serving as examples for developers to use when coding their own integration.\n\n## Features\n* **Expandable equipment slots through a central library.** New equipment slots can be made and managed easily through an identifier registry. Identical identifiers will be merged together to avoid functional redundancies and provide maximum compatibility to potential items, while unique identifiers can still be used to mark special types when appropriate.\n* **Slots are only made on-demand.** There are no slots included by default, all slots are created only as needed. This reduces instances where one or more superfluous slots are present without any suitable items to go into the slot.\n* **Slots are completely customizable and manipulable.** Slots can have custom backgrounds, different sizes, and can even be disabled or hidden by default. But how would a player even access disabled slots? Through the API, developers can access functions to enable/disable a player's slots or add/remove a certain number of slots of a given type.\n* **Flexible item->curio relations using the vanilla tag system.** Potential curios are selected through the vanilla tag system, which means that categorizing items into curio types is as easy as creating a .json file in the data/curios/tags folder. Items can be categorized into as many curio types as you want as long as they're tagged in the appropriate files, and these settings can even be overridden entirely. For more information, see the vanilla tag system.\n* **Complete integration with other inventory mechanics.** Mending and Curses will work with all applicable items equipped in the curio slots. There are also various minor features for developers that make it simpler to integrate their current items or mechanics into the curio system.\n* **Accessible from a single GUI.** Curios comes with its own GUI accessible from the inventory that shows all of the available slots to a player. This allows players to see all of the extended equipment slots in a central location without needing to access different inventory GUIs. However, developers can still provide their own GUIs for their mod-specific slots if they want. The default keybinding for the GUI is 'g'.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/NNByxcQ/curiogui.png)\n\n## Documentation\n* [How to Use: Users](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/How-to-Use:-Users)\n* [How to Use: Developers](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/How-to-Use:-Developers)\n* [Commands](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/Commands)\n* [Frequently Used Slots](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/Frequently-Used-Slots)\n* [Adding to Your Project](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios#adding-to-your-project)","published":"2023-02-03T01:35:59.131618Z","updated":"2023-10-03T07:47:34.164441Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":68899,"followers":137,"categories":["equipment","library","utility"],"additional_categories":["adventure"],"game_versions":["1.13.2","1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["ZOlETE5v","RcA3vNIJ","oxBwmsHU","BcHPbGLy","Hm7rMu2c","bE5ThdZW","kWbiHplj","L0vjJCcV","FgmAnDM9","tnz2VF5O","EOOHEkth","vMbFvqVI","T123DHPM","N0zclyEx","WhjxWZUb","9eeEgj08","FK7tyAY3","M9lGrwqm","5qPuCFYD","zkj9iD0D","46cAcdnU","tl7biScA","cpywqo8V","BenekUpa","jVW2AKPB","hTLLayrx","uvQEq1xO","hW3XKfcj","p4wqBrgO","h3K3CopK","SeLn387u","dlv1r8No","GbHsY4Wa","9yUPTnRR","q9hLiOWr","mZaeXk5V","CQtJcas9","Kw26k0tE","XdwwXlEI","HgHicKvP","l0t6GlWP"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/vvuO3ImH/2a7323ca80849de0bcb50299e18acdf8bf394682.png"},"version":{"id":"zkj9iD0D","project_id":"vvuO3ImH","author_id":"zbpHS3ry","featured":false,"name":"curios-forge-1.19.3-5.1.4.1","version_number":"1.19.3-5.1.4.1","changelog":"The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project adheres to [Forge Recommended Versioning](https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/conventions/versioning/).\n\nThis is a copy of the changelog for the most recent version.

Once you have at least 12 eyes, you can follow them until you reach the Stronghold. You have to put <strong>the 12 custom eyes in the portal in order to open it</strong>. If there's a vanilla eye of ender in one of the frames, you can remove it by right clicking on it with a custom eye.</span><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\"><br /></span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/PuRYpVn.png\" alt=\"The Eyes\" width=\"1042\" height=\"174\" /></span><span style=\"font-family: trebuchet ms, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">The Eyes are a really important part of End Remastered, just like Vanilla Ender Eyes, they allow you to activate the portal to the End. However, unlike Vanilla Ender Eyes, they are not dropped by Endermen, but must be found by exploring, fighting and mining.

All mobs can additionally become persistent when spawned from a spawn egg or the <code>/summon</code> command, although this specific behavior is disabled by default.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In case the changes to animal spawning mechanics break the behavior of another mod, a <strong>Blacklist</strong> for individual animals can be found in the config file.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2I6rTiy.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"16\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>✏️ Notes:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The behavior of Respawnable Animals is controllable on a per world basis via the use of a custom <code>persistentAnimals</code> game rule. When the game rule is set to <code>false</code> this mod will take effect, which is the case for every world created with Respawnable Animals installed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">To prevent animals from vanishing out of farms in precious old worlds, the game rule will automatically be set to <code>true</code> for those. Enabling Respawnable Animals retroactively simply requires updating said game rule by executing <code>/gamerule persistentAnimals false</code>. In a survival world with cheats disabled the command can be run by temporarily hosting a lan session from the pause menu with cheats enabled.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Respawnable Animals runs purely on the <strong>server-side</strong>. It even works when using a vanilla client to connect to a Forge server having this mod installed.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2I6rTiy.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"16\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>🏆 Credits:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Developing Respawnable Animals was helped and inspired by:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/b3spectacled\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>B3spectacled</strong></span></a> for inspiring the idea behind this project with their <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/custom-spawns\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Custom Spawns</span></a> mod</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2I6rTiy.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"16\" /></p>","published":"2023-05-10T21:03:38.643378Z","updated":"2023-08-17T07:13:47.857010Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":893,"followers":27,"categories":["game-mechanics","mobs"],"additional_categories":["adventure","worldgen"],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["D5HGfNc5","7EyIARHa","XBlB9nCp","I70BGD6W","swSQRnaV","UCWI8RxQ","BSNLebvS","v7ycbZ7O","OXBRf5bv","RvpMjRub","NU6xkngP","Rtle0vOI","rfTx5X1Z","c4kGVgt5","R65fOJX8","irtVKuXe"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/WnwcSeWc/e662181edcad933421cc3c658d5405d31a778401.png"},"version":{"id":"D5HGfNc5","project_id":"WnwcSeWc","author_id":"rHdGpxOA","featured":false,"name":"[FORGE] [1.19.3] RespawningAnimals-v5.0.0","version_number":"v5.0.0-1.19.3-Forge","changelog":"# Changelog\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.\n\nThe format is based on [Keep a Changelog].\n\n## [v5.0.0-1.19.3] - 2023-05-11\n- Ported to Minecraft 1.19.3 including a public Fabric release\n\n[Keep a Changelog]: https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-05-11T09:34:38.447594Z","downloads":13,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"9076b5d893d4282189b1068942a41afee61dad81508ac9afd21b47318f35a725dda4aebbe5018518bb3c234a3d55c1deb3c38ae77bcc0c9b72e02d15d60e2a44","sha1":"8de621a73b9fdc5eb7a817ccdc220b64ad0311a1"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/WnwcSeWc/versions/D5HGfNc5/RespawningAnimals-v5.0.0-1.19.3-Forge.jar","filename":"RespawningAnimals-v5.0.0-1.19.3-Forge.jar","primary":true,"size":71310,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"OXRJbrn6","project_id":"QAGBst4M","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.19.3"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"16LTXWDj","user":{"id":"rHdGpxOA","username":"Fuzs","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28218241?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-03-28T20:59:56.133727Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"RespawningAnimals-v5.0.0-1.19.3-Forge.jar"},"mods\\geckolib-forge-1.19.3-4.0.6.jar":{"sha512":"3807820f0c7252cdb02cf3426e7da1958438150f9be9d31eb74bce2fe57d2517469526b54ef43337dca3f6de2335b1c71cecd85538f08b4bfedba8fdcc950c48","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"8BmcQJ2H","slug":"geckolib","project_type":"mod","team":"XGT1SohE","title":"Geckolib","description":"A 3D animation library for entities, blocks, items, armor, and more!","body":"<center>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1073846495348019200/1074431979472293999/Image.jpg\" alt=\"logo\"/> \n\n<a href=\"https://discord.gg/sJb8TVjW\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/discord/730912704776110121?color=green&label=Discord&logo=Discord&logoColor=green&style=for-the-badge\" alt=\"discord\"/></a> <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/geckosmods\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/endpoint.svg?url=https://shieldsio-patreon.vercel.app/api?username=geckosmods&type=patrons&style=for-the-badge&color=green&logoColor=green\" alt=\"patreon\"/> </a>\n\n<h1 style=\"font-size:10vw\">GeckoLib is an animation engine for Minecraft Mods, with support for complex 3D keyframe-based animations, 30+ easings, concurrent animation support, sound and particle keyframes, event keyframes, and more.

Features\n\nFixed biome temperature cache memory leak which eats a lot of memory, now it gives a huge performance boost to the memory.\n\n### Modpack Permissions\n\nSaturn is a free and open-source

Due to this it has some code practices that are no longer used and makes development and collaboration harder. In respons we've started to recode it using more modern methods, to stay up to date and more compatible with other mods.

Feel free to come to our Discord server  [https://discord.gg/jYyyv7zhSW](https://discord.gg/jYyyv7zhSW)\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Isn't Vivecraft for Forge?\nIn the past Vivecraft was only available on Forge. However, we have rewritten it so it can run on Fabric and Quilt as well.\n\n### Can other players see my hands/What about NONVR, VSE and VFE?\nThis mod also has **NONVR included** in the jar. VR Is disabled by default, and can be enabled in the Main menu.\n\nFor other players to see you hands you will need to have this mod and a serverside mod. The serverside extensions (VSE and VFE) *work* as well as fabric works with them, however you **do not need to use them**. This mod will run in NONVR mode on the server allowing you to see other peoples hands. Since 1.0.0 it is also customizable like the standalone server mods.\n\n### Does it work with MCXR?\nNo this is a separate mod, and does not interface with MCXR\n\n### Does it run natively on the Quest?\nNo, but maybe in the future. \nIn the meantime, there is [Questcraft](https://questcraft.org/ \"https://questcraft.org/\") which uses a modified version of this, to make it compatible with the Oculus/Meta Quest.\n\n### What about Sodium/Iris ... Will it work?\nSodium does work.\nIris works.\nAny other mod is untested. Mod compatibility is an important thing to us, however, it is not simple. For now we focus on getting it to be stable, after which, we will work on compatibility.\n\n### What about Optifine?\nSince 1.0.0 Optifine is compatible with the mod, but not required\n\n### What about 1.19.0?\nThere is one version available for it, but it will not get any further updates.","published":"2022-09-05T18:56:09.045191Z","updated":"2023-10-12T01:17:14.044723Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":36629,"followers":219,"categories":["game-mechanics","library"],"additional_categories":["utility"],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","23w13a_or_b"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["rPsuSvmr","OpkjsSWH","aB0rF95L","eLJm9dQD","m3mtHRE7","3cs5bbKS","1fybWUMG","zQikY8nx","zm1kQhh2","A9UwaVJH","XtgCncAy","oG2wzMMs","zFMrHqFl","A4Qp4FNH","V3kwZYnq","EUxQkAau","XNMd5A8s","vxgPBH9t","9ClAyVkk","ylotc9XA","c4GVVDt9","7DoAhT6I","hH2WREzi","oJ0VxFIg","WBwBdTX1","GJCsuaN9","XJoINSsa","4hA4xhWQ","Su6fgfmB","Q9CH9xrP","nrXZX9to","oUXhhWmY","JHzvX05b","2a4thqoQ","zyWe7Stu","oz3ekfuS","dOEvFwko","L6RNCTmc","qgPPCQd8","PlC5FH4q","734yK5dP","kZxYYjJL","gUmcLmSU","nCDZVWMR","KtOSPp6N","hVkMOY1N","PeIYFrho","ocB2DmA0","vgEChuPI","Tf6d0imJ","CEYZSmz6","rweHuR9Q","FShXrtq1","TFANY1Cg","eIni94Pv","eXCDAKT9","7IpbBPkT","ObIsEBMg","k7kRkE5X","VDDW0akX","BRfGFMNk","UcRi43sa","7nxCHV22","l8DN6Hs7","8Tyjgyyp","uE8vnQjs","5HCJmiRu","84ZbnWde","KNZGPnrx","dg8l9Q15","8affVTqp","D1NT0xDw","mvIlT1Gz","SEZd5kZQ","TMNCSxke"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/wGoQDPN5/f55ecb94626ba1e51977b217d6a58f500cd86ca1.png"},"version":{"id":"eXCDAKT9","project_id":"wGoQDPN5","author_id":"qIiO9UwX","featured":false,"name":"Vivecraft 1.19.3-1.1.0-forge","version_number":"1.19.3-1.1.0-forge","changelog":"- new:\r\n  -

This is required for mod configuration, as it allows for using the exact same system as on the Forge mod loader.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/E6BUT4h.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; line-height: 36px;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/fuzs_/projects\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=Fuzs_&amp;color=ecebe6&amp;labelColor=2F4858&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=curseforge&amp;logoColor=white\" width=\"97\" height=\"28\" /></a>&emsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/Fuzss\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=Fuzss&amp;color=ecebe6&amp;labelColor=2F4858&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=github&amp;logoColor=white\" width=\"97\" height=\"28\" /></a>&emsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2l26SuCmCNSCPefpfbCX7Q\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=Fuzs&amp;color=ecebe6&amp;labelColor=2F4858&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=youtube&amp;logoColor=white\" width=\"89\" height=\"28\" /></a>&emsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Fusseel\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=@Fusseel&amp;color=ecebe6&amp;labelColor=2F4858&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=twitter&amp;logoColor=white\" width=\"124\" height=\"28\" /></a>&emsp;<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Fusseel\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=u/Fusseel&amp;color=ecebe6&amp;labelColor=2F4858&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=reddit&amp;logoColor=white\" alt=\"Reddit\" width=\"130\" height=\"28\" /></a>&emsp;<img src=\"https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=Fuzs%200212&amp;color=ecebe6&amp;labelColor=2F4858&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=discord&amp;logoColor=white\" width=\"127\" height=\"28\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/E6BUT4h.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>","published":"2022-07-06T18:55:14.270853Z","updated":"2023-08-16T10:09:58.305692Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":299932,"followers":470,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["n3g4OsEQ","4bHK0bos","Z3scKqNL","4T4HZk3f","jrxiZIJg","ggK4alzB","3FVGVSRL","3R2noZBz","GEaTK1To","MORtFjT7","SRIg4iQn","1osO35Q5","vy6Bovd4","wQvOrCfA","ZwirJqdf","O8agM1Hz","vi5hw79t","8ae5TjLO","yDmfcIc3","V7IXjDfj","o5YLPKfR","U7RPCAL4","w1IA6pkN","1PvxPgTS","Dfk6Kdpk","R9uwqQnV","mH2iiwlr","Pg6wh6Id","48jeSKzO","E9Qlol2T","V5LBscZ6","s6sGKfbx","bRZ6AoTv","9VA381uD","ZxiflfQp","1DmyxKmi","jA529ngn","JSEHdamZ","BpOQ6Lqg","SJGSFBMc","iYV1Feh5","gd0G2hhz","Ez5gkdlU","45edveqj","oQsbSTy3","6NuJBhyA","Dp7R36Xs","jgMObcuM","2bEMzr1L","6GQc3co6","BP33eOxU","D9vM6NoG","b4lBddf3","wZcJ8cWK","y4nUf0PC","XWUp4icb","i21HIDqx","h6zwrOXh","mC47wVQz","FCWQcWnv","8CR0bnID","HwzoFHC1","VGj1zGrn","FkILlZd7","p1tTNyCv","fL77THCh","Lm5gebmK","LGbvfJUd","2ztHmiwc","YoJzLFN6","VPPkHE7i","z7svCBW6","kwepeOdS","xDxHThlp","FHljGbgZ","WtjnkHmQ","5uHrsodn","ObWocDjJ","Gx40SdoU","m2m1WsQC","NjsLQCQh","LSUMYLnt","NRIoCBh3","iKGK4NBG","QpkkVVyn","4DEcuUZZ","fgZrY52r","8QmUx5Fl","mPEMMhvN","2kp8bKQO","rD8mGLPb","L5GPGt7F","DFhQb5uf","JrupytDU","GwsJMvCw","hP9hXoCe","1lSk5VZh","rO6E3jGm","LZOEQVQC","i2xTbv7Y","a8ZgypYg","h1ns5GaM","rKfjKi33","yeHvhYOD","ns69L8dI","sv1iPMzi","OXRJbrn6","PxXJo3k4","KFG50Qhy","6As7amla","op5e6xRq","7ABrOIgA","zizb6yD6","KCA6vQD5","UCiKAgMn","zBzpSBKZ","KoZGuWml","QiVyRzQB","690IIFFZ","TkxPgn47","R1uJEZ31","7yxa655A","P6S26sSD","7fAHr6w5","IEXOIGVL","wCK8ij3a","lf6PGWwe","OKZ6mA1W","pvuBqFqb","DHk61kCu","SuhOII0F","cPGoonJT","yP5oQ3Ak","Fnlslono","Bp8RvlYw","bEmPd1vO","9Q6cCSz6","UUEjLtmS","GpusdAdv","gd7iDa09","UbCrBSit","hYKHLRZ3","qdNeRisk","Q1j5L2yM","KmQylKLN","lSd7CXvO","g8d307PL","TwMB98sM","31TqmnJN","a5MLEWK6","WyvOkbnG","e0aWlelt","WjRzXRln","Noj6vMtz","5r3BfjAc","H9EbhiH7","hPp2iJwv","RUsPffnS","Y5Kjea08","51n2dMFU","gAz4ZDBl","RayW5xBY","V4g0yKzo","wfZ1WUlB","Lr1pamFx","rNieKbmF","RDV4dG9C","1UwAgU9l","paSPjnHb","ItncP8dX","8BIig8L5","HEzEuCRw","UMRz9cBy","tcY2bo8S","LTuYPgiM","8mMvpXiC","cJqMmNyP","qiuZsD4R","RVGrKpDw","gJPobzvP","d3flGMAv","ZwbaWApq","83sS3ngW","jLn169xV","RYhkOF7A","3aTpS1mg","ZtDMfIUN","dXLl9uWi","Sk64RP7y","KGAO1rK6","nEMiPLZ0","bKkfr7ay"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/QAGBst4M/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"OXRJbrn6","project_id":"QAGBst4M","author_id":"rHdGpxOA","featured":false,"name":"[FORGE] [1.19.3] PuzzlesLib-v5.0.33","version_number":"v5.0.33-1.19.3-Forge","changelog":"# Changelog\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.\n\nThe format is based on [Keep a Changelog].\n\n## [v5.0.33-1.19.3] -

Variants","description":"Automatically generated stone variants of ores","body":"# Excavated Variants\n\nForge version requires: [Dynamic Asset Generator](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamic_asset_generator)\n\nQuilt version requires: [Dynamic Asset Generator](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamic_asset_generator) and [Quilt Standard Libraries](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl)\n&nbsp;\n\nAdds automatically generated variants of ores based on various stones.\n\n## Details:\n\nMany mods add new stones or new ores. _Excavated Variants_ automatically adds new ores for each combination of ore and stone variant. Additionally, _Excavated Variants_ attempts to set up world gen for these ore variants. The variants added can be changed in the config file; some mods are built in to the default configuration; others will have to be manually added. See _Images_ tab of _Curseforge_ page for examples of generated ores.\n\n## Troubleshooting:\n\nRunning into issues? Start here!\n\n* If world or game loading times are slow, try turning on asset and/or data caching in the config for _Dynamic Asset Generator_.\n* Is the game crashing on launch? Do ore textures turn magenta and black? Something may be wrong with your config. Try removing and resetting it.\n* Are you missing compatibility for a mod listed below? Delete your configs to reset them to the default.\n\n## Compatibility:\n\n_Excavated Variants_ comes with default configs that include ore variants for the following mods, in addition to vanilla stones and ores:\n\n* Quark\n* Create\n* Oh The Biomes You'll Go\n* Tech Reborn\n* Immersive Engineering\n* Blockus\n* Better End\n* Better Nether\n* Promenade\n* Twigs\n* Unearthed\n* Bewitchment\n* Mekanism\n* Mystical Agriculture\n* And more!\n\n## Config Format\n\nThe main config file, `config/excavated_variants.json`, contains several options:\n\n* **attempt\\_worldgen\\_replacement**: Toggles ore-gen changes; without this, ores won't be replaced during world gen.\n* **add\\_conversion\\_recipes**: Toggles whether to add recipes to convert variants back to the base ore.\n* **jei\\_rei\\_compat**: Toggles compatibility with JEI and REI for added conversion recipes.\n\nAll other configs are loaded through the globalresources folder. You may add new config files there directly, but if you want to extract the built-in \nconfigs in order to edit them, open the `defaultresources.json` config file. It should look something like as follows:\n```json\n{\n  \"extract\": {\n    \"excavated_variants\": \"unextracted\"\n  }\n}\n```\nChange `unextracted` to `extract` and load the game once. Now, the default configs will be available to edit in the `globalresources` folder.\n\n**Note**: If you just want to add more configs, you do not need to (and should not) do this. You can add new config files without extracting existing ones.\n\nConfigs relating to how ores are registered are added in `globalresources/[folder]/excavated_variants/[namespace]/configs`. They can contain the following \noptions:\n\n* **blacklist**: A way of excluding certain variants from being created. It takes a list of filters. See below for the format.\n* **priority**: Allows certain config files to be loaded before others, in the order specified within. These should be a namespaced location of the variant config file.\n\nConfigs for adding stones or ores are placed in `globalresources/[folder]/excavated_variants/[namespace]/variants`. These take the following format:\n\n* **mod\\_id**: The ID of the mod necessary for this config to load, or a list of IDs for the required mods.\n* **provided_stones**: A list of stones provided by the config.\n* **provided_ores**: A list of ores provided by the config.\n\nEach ore object takes the following format:\n\n* **id**: A name for this ore. Can be shared to avoid duplicate ores.\n* **stone**: A list of stones, by id, that this ore already appears in.\n* **ore\\_name**: A list of other names for this ore, to be used when adding the ore to tags. Optional; if not supplied, defaults to **id**.\n* **block\\_id**: A list of blocks of this ore, in the same order as **stone**.\n* **lang**: A map of locale keys to the name to be given to this ore in-game.\n* **types**: A list of types that this ore is classified as. Matched at runtime with the types specified in stone configs.\n\nEach stone object takes the following format:\n\n* **id**: A name for this ore. Can be shared to avoid duplicate ores.\n* **block\\_id**: The block ID of this stone.\n* **lang**: A map of locale keys to the name to be given to this stone in-game.\n* **types**: A list of types that this stone is classified as. Matched at runtime with the types specified in ore configs.\n\nModifier configs are added in `globalresources/[folder]/excavated_variants/[namespace]/modifiers`. They allow you to configure the properties of created variants, and can contain the following options:\n\n* **filter**: A filter for selecting variants to modify. See below for the format.\n* **properties** (optional): Modifies block properties. Takes the following arguments:\n  * **destroy_time** (optional): The time to destroy the block.\n  * **explosion_resistance** (optional): The time to destroy the block.\n  * **xp** (optional): The experience dropped by the block. Can take the same sort of integer range as seen in vanilla datapacks.\n* **tags** (optional): A list of tags to add the filtered ores to. Can be either block or item tags, in the format `\"namespace:<blocks/items>/path\"`.\n* **flags** (optional): A list of flags to apply to the variants. The following flags are recognized:\n  * `\"original_always\"`: Variant always drops the original ore instead of the variant block.\n  * `\"original_without_silk\"\"`: Variant drops the original ore instead of the variant block, but only if mined without silk touch.\n\nFilters take the form of a string specifying the filter, such as `\"ore:iron_ore\"`. Can take the following forms:\n\n* `type:type_id` matches every variant with an ore and stone of type `type_id`.

These can stretch higher than vanilla mountains do, sometimes reaching peaks above y300!\n\n### Underground Rivers\n\nIn mountainous terrain that is too towering to allow regular river generation, terrain gets carved for rivers to continue underground. These link right up to the regular rivers, so there's no interruption in exploring along rivers.  Very deep underground, you can even find a deeper variant with lava instead of water.\n\n### Oceanside Cliffs\n\nOn steep cliff faces in the Stony Shore biome, waves and wind carve into the cliff. (Disclaimer: waves and wind not included.)\n\n### Smoother Surfaces\n\nOne of (if not the most) notable changes to generation you'll see with Tectonic is that terrain is much smoother than normal. This means the strange staircasing on some hills - also referred to as \"lerp\" issues - is gone. In previous Tectonic versions this meant that Windswept biomes were removed from generation, but in v2 and above they will once again generate.\n\n### Dunes\n\nSmooth desert dunes will generate in some Desert biomes, giving Deserts a special look to them.\n\n### Deeper Oceans\n\nOceans are much deeper than they are in vanilla, with deep oceans even extending into the deepslate layer!\n\n-----\n\n### Removed Features\n\nPrevious versions of Tectonic included things like custom biomes, trees, and more. These were removed for both performance and compatibility reasons.

You'll now find new terrain shapes like multi-tiered plateaus, and windswept terrain (with more terrain shapes coming in future versions).

The difference is that Sodium does a really quick pass based on the visible chunks, being way less aggressive and thereby still rendering entities that just happen to be in visible chunks, but not visible themselves.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Does this have to be installed on the Server?\n\nNo, this is fully Client-side and can't be installed on servers.\n\n### Will this influence farms/mobs?\n\nNo. Since this mod just skips the rendering, mobs will still spawn/move/drop items.\n\n## Credits\n\nRoboTricker created the original server-side async raytracing occlusion culling implementation for Transport-Pipes.","published":"2022-05-25T10:09:09.784330Z","updated":"2023-09-22T17:07:54.581205Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1942218,"followers":3120,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.3-pre1","1.19.3-pre2","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.8.8","1.8.9"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["WiIRU3UP","AXYavMt5","Qek7k92S","2WBkUuat","2mzFyULh","mlP64Wt9","4GD4dwQK","LQ3vI7aU","WdlVJYKE","R0KPBo5r","1Vc3QD0W","b2cBCjB4","bRBO9ZzX","Wq0up4B4","bE2TQ25z","reIgRPky","N7HJbtfe","AdkBUIRs","WR6z6MYC","twdGLDHv","jFORrKV6","d3CbGntl","UvJN5Cy4","NB6TPjI8","374z4jcq","d20sUcYn","17Hi340V","BDwHAdWc"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"N7HJbtfe","project_id":"NNAgCjsB","author_id":"Qnt13hO8","featured":true,"name":"1.6.1-1.19.3 - Forge","version_number":"1.6.1-1.19.3","changelog":"Changes:\r\n- Add create entites to the default ticking whitelist\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/compare/1.6.0-1.19.3...1.6.1-1.19.3","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-02-19T17:30:07.552759Z","downloads":2721,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"5898da2807b20fa56b4f0af3d76f0efa18c9abcd","sha512":"72dc5d4873efa3b02709008983b110d08a90285b7da664377b6f0b6c2c225bc299efa0e75047b16069461f6dc65bf921b318d5ce5c47f76daa5ae95748b786ff"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/versions/N7HJbtfe/entityculling-forge-1.6.1-mc1.19.3.jar","filename":"entityculling-forge-1.6.1-mc1.19.3.jar","primary":true,"size":59196,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19.3"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"hLPrl6Gq","user":{"id":"Qnt13hO8","username":"tr7zw","name":"tr7zw","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/Qnt13hO8/icon.png","bio":"https://tr7zw.dev/","created":"2022-05-04T13:41:52.033912Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"entityculling-forge-1.6.1-mc1.19.3.jar"},"mods\\edf-remastered-4.2.0.jar":{"sha512":"e197ef78ae2f8c7e2e7644e59e780596b468dee01bc116a1cee978d32831af81ec3f5b0001d083bb3da539397a3274b1551b53897f082dfa36ac561aacc1ac13","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"HQsBdHGd","slug":"edf-remastered","project_type":"mod","team":"jjgwjnpw","title":"Ender Dragon Fight Remastered","description":"An up in difficulty for Minecraft's final boss.\nWith more health and more attacks, the fight finally feels like the final confrontation.","body":"**Hey there!

It also adds boss music, to add that final boss feel. The Ender Dragon even has a second phase when she reaches half health!\n\nPlus, instead of a wimpy 200 health, the Ender Dragon now has 500 health, making it a lot harder.\n\nLet the fight begin.\n\nIf you want to make the music quieter, it is the \"Jukebox/Note Blocks\" slider in Music and Sounds.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Recommended Mods</summary>\n\n### These mods are pretty good when used together with EDFR.

When she becomes Mad, she will respawn 3 end crystals and be able to use Mad attacks. She can only become Mad once, even if her health goes above half again.\n\nMad attacks (only used after the dragon reaches half health):\n\n4. Teleport to random end crystal location.\n5. Strike lightning on everyone (if you are moving, the lightning will appear where you were a second ago.)\n6. Summon anvils 20 blocks above everyone (more visual flare planned)\n7. Spawns miniboss (only one miniboss can exist at once, and only one miniboss can be spawned per fight, and the dragon will no longer move while miniboss is in existence, so you have to kill the miniboss)\n\nThe attacks are subject to change as I plan on adding more and changing some.\n</details>\n\nThis datapack is supposed to make the battle feel more epic.\n\nWant to suggest an attack?

No prior knowledge of Minecraft: Story Mode is required! One of the goals of this mod is to abstract the Wither Storm from the game as much as possible, so anyone can play.\n‎\nTo summon the Wither Storm, locate the rundown house at X: 0, Z: 0, and place the last wither skull on top of the incomplete wither-like structure!\n‎\n**I'd highly recommend going through this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tjxqGfvqKNMHIZaDc6HeT4RAoxKhr2v1loB0_Tyx42c/edit?usp=sharing \"Guide\") to get started playing in survival**\n‎\n![Features](https://i.imgur.com/hmbYLkr.png \"Features\")\n\n• _**The Wither Storm:**_\n\nGrows and evolves by absorbing its surroundings. \n\n\nHas the ability to track the nearest player from wherever, and may occasionally chase them.\n\nThe Wither Storm has the ability to chunk load wherever, without the presence of a player, meaning the Wither Storm is always active \n\nYou can see the Wither Storm up to and over 10 000 blocks away thanks to the distant renderer added by the mod \n\nThe Wither Storm can pick up clusters of blocks, which can be entire trees or even villager houses! \n\nThe Wither Storm can pick up and consume almost any mob \n\n• _**The Formidibomb**_\n\n• _**Boss Battles**_\n\n• _**Multiplayer compatibility**_\n\n• _**Built-in config and config menu for customizability**_\n\n• _**New tools and weapons**_\n\n• _**Wither Sickness**_\n\n• _**And more!**_\n\n![Notes](https://i.imgur.com/XuK7OIv.png \"Notes\")\n\n• **If you're having issues with the Wither Storm never evolving and/or you can't see it on singleplayer worlds and you're using OptiFine, make sure \"Smooth World\" under \"Performance\" under \"Video Settings\" is disabled.**\n\n• **Superflat worlds will need to be reloaded after world creation to make sure that the bowels is loaded in 1.19**\n\n**This mod completely changes the way you play Minecraft.** I would not recommend summoning the Wither Storm on a pre-existing world, if it's your only copy and it's one that you care about. \n\nPorts to the latest Minecraft version will happen eventually. **Versions below 1.19.4 are no longer supported and will only be updated to fix game breaking issues/bugs.**\n\nI will not be porting to older versions.  \n\nCertain features may deviate from what is seen in MC:SM. I also don't plan on adding other mobs from the game into this mod specifically.   \n\nIf certain aspects feel unbalanced, or you'd like to suggest a specific feature, I'd recommend going to the mod's GitHub repository and submitting an issue. \n\nRecipes for the blocks and items should get unlocked as you progress through the mod. Use your recipe book to check them out.\n\n![Faq](https://i.imgur.com/Y4JPRmM.png \"Faq\")\n\n• **Where is the \"server config?\"**\n\nIf you're on singleplayer, the server config can be accessed via Pause Menu &gt; Options &gt; Purple \"W\" button, then clicking the \"World Options\" button. If you'd like to access it out of game (or your world is on a server), you can locate your world file (in your saves folder), go to the \"serverconfig\" file and open the witherstormmod-server.toml. Note: The server config is unique for each world. Changes made will not be applied to other saves.\n\n• **\"How do I make the Wither Storm evolve quicker?\"**\n\nBy going to the same server config, change the \"evolutionAttributeModifier\" to a value below 1, the quickest allowed being 0.1. You will need to reload your world to apply this change! You can also use the /attribute command to change the evolution speed.\n\n• **\"Fabric?\"**\n\nCurrently no.\n\n• **\"Can you port to [Insert Version Here]?\"**\n\nIf it's for a new version of the game, patience, it's coming. **We will not be backporting to older versions however.**\n\n• **\"Can I use this in my modpack?\"**\n\nYes! Just make sure to provide credit and a link back to this page\n\n[Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sdp3vsS0o8DUnyE70AsK-nN8ueqp2Xg6LJFI5jS_YSE/edit?usp=sharing \"Guide\")  \n[Preferences and Performance](https://github.com/nonamecrackers2/crackers-wither-storm-mod/wiki/Preferences-and-Performance \"Preferences and Performance\")  \n[Known Compatibility Issues](https://github.com/nonamecrackers2/crackers-wither-storm-mod/wiki/Known-Compatibility-Issues \"Known Compatibility Issues\")  \n[Commands and Technical](https://github.com/nonamecrackers2/crackers-wither-storm-mod/wiki/Commands-and-Technical \"Commands and Technical\")  \n[Copyright Info](https://github.com/nonamecrackers2/crackers-wither-storm-mod/wiki/Copyright-Info \"Copyright Info\")  \n[Advanced Modification](https://github.com/nonamecrackers2/crackers-wither-storm-mod/wiki/Advanced-Modification \"Advanced Modification\")\n\n[![BH Banner](https://i.imgur.com/T8fKJrM.png \"BH Banner\")](https://bisecthosting.com/nonamecrackers \"BH Promo\")","published":"2023-02-22T16:03:38.842065Z","updated":"2023-09-16T23:29:36.101939Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":76417,"followers":116,"categories":["adventure","cursed","mobs"],"additional_categories":["equipment","game-mechanics","worldgen"],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["iCxOYlut","ol35lCu5","QvnOlgfl","y7EnvMp4","25nvwYhQ","x1US85Y5","SJWEPqsg","LCqHrCUp","QyoE1NW1","HFydyYq7","zUFV45Xc","P2JA5RAy","3JBn4u7O","JoDvCqWR"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/kWjNGDUH/32bfe49f0bd7f80b370dc44c278d0b73ab5d40aa.png"},"version":{"id":"QyoE1NW1","project_id":"kWjNGDUH","author_id":"9wTmU90y","featured":false,"name":"1.19.3-3.2.1.1","version_number":"3.2.1.1","changelog":"Fixing an issue where the Wither Storm mass unloading bug fix wasn't implemented properly\n\n \nHuge thanks to my [patrons!](https://www.patreon.com/user?u=87070090)\n\n**Wither Storm Backers**\n\n- Storm909\n- kazuhiro gejo\n- Callum Saunders\n- Emoch\n- WizardOfZinks\n- TSEG\n \n**Withered Symbiont Backers**\n\n- TheSource\n- Panda Man.\n- Michael\n\n \n**Bug Fixes**\n\n- Fixed the Wither Storm mass unloading bug fix being implemented improperly","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-04-01T00:33:40.660527Z","downloads":2161,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"abfccea75edac5c30a9d2fa93607f2339c7b2e77","sha512":"083cf9f7ddfbd2c7284e53a469ba73f734a2a12976963caba1191ebde0c0480f54dad3ad70a1fb83ba8fab672674e9834081103ae82828f6ec623caa9e31ff3a"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/kWjNGDUH/versions/QyoE1NW1/witherstormmod-1.19.3-3.2.1.1.jar","filename":"witherstormmod-1.19.3-3.2.1.1.jar","primary":true,"size":23898390,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19.3"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"DYfedHYi","user":{"id":"n1r6Cb4M","username":"McFella","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/n1r6Cb4M/ce5cef6691edd86b00061b358d2a24485f909767.png","bio":null,"created":"2022-08-06T21:12:30.055655Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Artist","ordering":0},{"team_id":"DYfedHYi","user":{"id":"9wTmU90y","username":"nonamecrackers2","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105086648?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-05-31T17:16:21.154173Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"witherstormmod-1.19.3-3.2.1.1.jar"},"mods\\BuriedWrecks-1.19.3-2.0.0.jar":{"sha512":"2c103dc498e7c759488ce4dd37ea9ed1f4b6029a987528ccc9c0f6c5205623e389d73e7cc419a4f6fee33c790c2bb1963aea03860f65617fe5631072c719202f","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"ip66WlTo","slug":"buried-wrecks","project_type":"mod","team":"8c082PNN","title":"Buried Wrecks","description":"A mod that adds buried shipwrecks to the underground","body":"Have you ever thought to yourself \"Minecraft caves are lacking something\".

change text size, color, location, duration, &amp; more</li>\n<li><b>Includes built-in titles for many modded dimensions</b> - Atum, Twilight Forest, Bumblezone, Lost Cities, &amp; more!</li>\n<li>Supports <b>all modded biomes</b></li>\n<li>Supports <b>custom titles with the Waystones mod!</b> Will display a Waystone's title when you're near it (1.18+ Forge only)</li>\n<li>Supports <b>custom sounds</b> when entering new biomes, dimensions, or Waystone regions</li>\n<li>Dimension &amp; biome blacklisting</li>\n</ul>\n\n## Beautiful Custom Dimension Titles \n\n<p>\nTry out the beautiful <a title=\"Visual Traveler's Titles\" href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/visual-travelers-titles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Visual Traveler's Titles</a> resource pack add-on by UnRoman for completely custom dimension titles! It includes support for a <em>bunch</em> of modded dimensions.\n</p>\n\n## Adding Custom Sounds\n<p>To use custom sounds, all you have to do is create a small resource pack with the namespace <code>travelerstitles</code>. In the <code>sounds</code> folder, you can add any or all of three custom sounds, named <code>dimension.ogg</code>, <code>biome.ogg</code>, and <code>waystone.ogg</code>. Each of these sounds will play when entering a new dimension, biome, and waystone, respectively. If no custom sound is provided for any of these, then no sound will play for the respective type of title.\n</p>\n\n## Additional Customization\n<p>Using lang files in resource packs, you can add your own dimension &amp; biome titles!<br />\nDimensions use a lang entry format like the following:</p>\n<p><code>\"travelerstitles.namespace.dimensionname\": \"Title\"</code></p>\n<p>Biomes use the same lang entries as always, guaranteeing built-in support for any mod's biomes, like so:</p>\n\n<p><code>\"biome.namespace.biomename\": \"Title\"</code></p>\n\n<p>However, should you want to change a vanilla or modded biome's title without potentially affecting other areas of the game that might use the biome's translation, you can use a special format specifically for this mod via the following:\n</p>\n\n<p><code>\"travelerstitles.biome.namespace.biomename\": \"Title\"</code></p>\n\n<p>Both dimensions and biomes also support an optional <code>color</code> lang entry which will override the configured default text color for that specific dimension or biome. The following is a complete example that adds a red title for the Nether and a green title for the Plains biome:<br />\n</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"travelerstitles.minecraft.the_nether\": \"The Nether\",\n\"travelerstitles.minecraft.the_nether.color\": \"ff0000\",\n\"travelerstitles.biome.minecraft.plains\": \"Plains\",\n\"biome.minecraft.plains.color\": \"00ff00\"</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that for a biome's <code>color</code> entry, it is also acceptable to have the key start with <code>travelerstitles</code>, and any biome color entry with <code>travelerstitles</code> prepended to it will take priority over other entries.<br />\nFor example, the following would resullt in blue (<code>0000ff</code>) text for the <code>desert</code> biome, since entries prepended with <code>travelerstitles</code> take priority:\n</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"biome.minecraft.desert.color\": \"ff0000\",\n\"travelerstitles.biome.desert.color\": \"0000ff\"</code></pre>\n\n<p>Also note that colors are RGB hex-formatted strings.</span></p>\n\n<p><a title=\"Lang entries\" href=\"https://github.com/YUNG-GANG/Travelers-Titles/tree/1.19/Common/src/main/resources/assets/travelerstitles/lang\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">See here</a> for the lang entries that come included with the mod in 1.19.2.

installed |\n\n## The GUI\n\nYou can open the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key.\nThis allows you to open the settings, group chats, mute yourself, disable the voice chat, start/stop a recording and hide all icons.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TCCHTl8.png)\n\n### Group Chats\n\nGroup chats allow you to talk to players that are not in your vicinity.\nTo open the group chat interface, either press the group button in the voice chat GUI or just press the `G` key.\n\nTo create a new group, just type a name in the text field and press the button next to it.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FihRdNd.png)\n\nCreating or joining a group will bring you into the group chat interface.\nYou will also see the heads of the group members in the top left corner of your screen.\nTalking players will be outlined.\nYou can disable these icons by pressing the third button from the left.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZVSfBms.png)\n\nPlayers that are not in a group will see a group icon next to your head, indicating that they can't talk to you.\n\nYou can invite players to your group chat by entering the command `/voicechat invite <playername>`.\n\n### Settings\n\nYou can access the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key and pressing the settings button.\n\nThis menu offers the ability to change the general voice chat volume and your microphone amplification.\nIn addition, there is the possibility to specify the recording and playback device.\n\nBy clicking the 'Enable microphone testing' button, you can hear your own voice and adjust the activation level of the voice activation.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TMyfSYU.png)\n\n## Important Notes\n\nYou need to open a port on the server.

It is intended to fit in with vanilla Minecraft, and so this datapack can be used in an ordinary survival world with minimal adjustments. See below for installation instructions.\n\nView my [GitHub page](https://github.com/Crystalis7/Hybrid-Beta) to access all releases (including older versions) and for issue tracking.\n\n**Similar Packs**\n\n- [Neo-Beta](https://planetminecraft.com/data-pack/neo-beta-datapack-beta-1-7-3-esque-terrain-generation-for-your-1-16-2-worlds/)/[Neo-Beta Plus](https://planetminecraft.com/data-pack/neo-beta-plus-modernized-beta-1-7-3-styled-terrain-for-1-16/) by [SkyDeckAGoGo](https://github.com/SkyDeckAGoGo/) and [Modern Beta](https://planetminecraft.com/data-pack/modern-beta-generate-beta-like-terrain-with-modern-biomes-compatible-with-20w29a/) by [b3spectacled](https://github.com/b3spectacled) (both for Minecraft 1.16)\n- [Betagen+](https://planetminecraft.com/data-pack/betagen-x/) by [schmoobalizer](https://planetminecraft.com/member/shmoobalizer/) (Minecraft 1.18)\n\n**Terrain**\n\nThe general style of the terrain has been made more wacky, with more unpredictable cliffs and overhangs present. There should be a balance of around 55:45 of crazier terrain to flatter terrain. Transitions from land to ocean have been made smoother, and the much-loved Beta sand and gravel beaches have been re-added! At the same time, the general trends of the terrain (i.e where the tall mountains, rivers and oceans are found) are still very similar to vanilla 1.18 and above. This means that any general terrain features you see in a vanilla seed should show up when using this datapack, but will of course be a little crazier!\n\n**Biomes**\n\nAlmost all vanilla biomes have been preserved and can be found in the same locations in a given seed as in vanilla. There are, however, a few exceptions, since some biomes had to be removed to make space for new ones:\n- Windswept Savannas and Old Growth Birch Forests have been replaced with the old Seasonal Forests from Beta\n- Windswept Hills and Windswept Forests have been replaced with a new biome called the Temperate Rainforest\n- Sparse Jungles have been renamed to Rainforests, and have been tweaked slightly to contain more big oak trees and tall ferns\n\nThere have also been some adjustments to existing biomes:\n-Since the old sand and gravel beaches have been re-added, this means that the (unsightly) sand, gravel and clay blobs have been removed. An implication of this would be that clay and gravel are more difficult to find. To make up for this, clay can now be found at bottom of lukewarm oceans and deep lukewarm oceans. Gravel already spawns at the bottom of most other ocean types (except warm), but the depth of the gravel has been increased instead of only occupying the floor block. This is, of course, in addition to gravel already spawning in Windswept Gravelly Hills and clay already spawning in the Lush Caves.\n- The dark foliage colours in the swamp biome have been removed, and the foliage colours in a couple of other biomes have been slightly adjusted.\n- The sky colours in all biomes have been changed to more accurately reflect how they were in Minecraft Beta.\n- There are probably a few more minor changes that I have forgotten.\n\nEverything else has been kept the same as vanilla, which means that the new caves added in 1.18 will still generate.\n\n**Installation**\n\n1. Download and extract the zip file into a folder\n2. (1.18 releases only - skip this step if creating a world in 1.19 and above): If a custom seed is desired, open the datapack folder and navigate to data/minecraft/dimension. For each of the three files present there (overworld.json, end.json, nether.json), open them and find the line (or lines in the case of end.json) containing the word 'seed' and enter the desired seed in place of the default seed, 0. Note that overworld.json file is much larger than the other two - the seed line in is located at the end of the file, but it may be easier to search for the word 'seed' using the search function by pressing CTRL-F.\n3. When creating a new Minecraft world, select Datapacks and drag the extracted file into the Minecraft window. Alternatively, add the file using the 'Open Pack Folder' button.\n4. Hover over the added datapack and press the arrow to move it into the 'Selected' column. Ensure that it is placed above the 'Default' pack.\n5. If a custom seed is being used, enter it in the box for the seed in 'More World Options'. (In 1.19 versions and above, the seed box can be left empty to use a random seed.)\n6. Create the world and enjoy!\n\n**Upgrading to a newer datapack version**\n\n1. Make a backup of the world you want to upgrade!\n2. Make sure that the datapack version you are upgrading to is compatible with the version of Minecraft you want to play on.\n3. In the folder for your world you wish to upgrade, navigate to the datapacks folder and replace the existing datapack with the new version you wish to upgrade to.\n4. (1.18 versions only: Enter the seed used for the world in the dimension files of the new datapack as specified in the Installation instructions above.)\n5. (When converting from 1.18.2 to 1.19 only: Use an NBT editor (e.g NBTExplorer) to open the level.dat file in the world save folder and check that the seed entry is set to the seed that was used when creating the world. This will ensure that there is smoothing between the 1.18 and 1.19 terrain.)\n6. Open the world in the new Minecraft version.\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\nThe texture pack used in the screenshots is a customised version of [Golden Days Base](https://planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/golden-days-beta-reversion-for-modern-minecraft/) by [PoeticRainbow](https://github.com/PoeticRainbow).\n\n**Credits**\n\n- [SkyDeckAGoGo](https://github.com/SkyDeckAGoGo/), [b3spectacled](https://github.com/b3spectacled) and [schmoobalizer](https://planetminecraft.com/member/shmoobalizer/) for their beta-style terrain generation datapacks which inspired me to make this one\n- All the contributors on the [Minecraft Configs](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraft_configs/) subreddit and their accompanying Discord Server\n- [jacobsjo](https://github.com/jacobsjo) and the brilliant tool they made, [Snowcapped](https://snowcapped.jacobsjo.eu/), which helped me to understand how terrain generation works in 1.18\n\nPlease feel free to leave comments with any questions, suggestions or feedback you may have. The datapack is still not completely polished and so any feedback/suggestions would be valuable to its future development. Finally, please do not redistribute this pack.","published":"2023-02-18T23:12:02.586321Z","updated":"2023-06-15T22:52:23.791602Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"required","downloads":1931,"followers":51,"categories":["worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["datapack","fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["8q1vpFT4","TXriww2y","aUpW4vse","L7cdlkf6","myriLoSN","ss8iljgn","gTAFE0w3","uu3b0cET"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Jmx5kJiS/784101164feaf574b3d141fa178f112ab10f933e.png"},"version":{"id":"L7cdlkf6","project_id":"Jmx5kJiS","author_id":"ZNMkfTQ4","featured":false,"name":"v0.10.1/1.19.2","version_number":"0.10.1+mod","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-05-01T21:19:33.406471Z","downloads":442,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"ac9f67021550e3d90cd1dd7550be4cb6ac4062cf4e54e25620056ceab68cc5bc6acfd6549f7b35566db859b60f98d6e2617f6f408bf02866521152fd0a2f16da","sha1":"8ac59fb9d061ec1cb6b36c7d422fe48d354fbe7b"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Jmx5kJiS/versions/L7cdlkf6/hybrid-beta-0.10.1.jar","filename":"hybrid-beta-0.10.1.jar","primary":true,"size":2607238,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"1a0Wv0LK","user":{"id":"ZNMkfTQ4","username":"Crystalis7","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80200718?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2023-02-18T23:11:14.209775Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"hybrid-beta-0.10.1.jar"},"mods\\notenoughcrashes-4.4.0+1.19.3-forge.jar":{"sha512":"c001f529170ea97be57013b6e7fbef018eb65ba15708a5971e06d72aad5c3adb658aea6cd75b72c62e560b26e090ff5720384179308dceb54206660c7c2c0f32","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"yM94ont6","slug":"notenoughcrashes","project_type":"mod","team":"Fq2yZa5i","title":"Not Enough Crashes","description":"When crashing, you can go back to the title screen and keep playing, without needing to restart, alongside other things to make crashes more pleasant.","body":"Not Enough crashes is a Minecraft mod that improves crashes in Minecraft.    \n NEC can be installed on the client and server independently.  \nFeatures include:\n\n- When crashing, you can go back to the title screen and keep playing, without needing to restart.\n- A convenient way to submit syntax-highlighted crash reports via a special crash screen.\n- Display a list of mods that were involved in the crash, and can be clicked to go to their issue tracker.\n- More useful stack traces that are deobfuscated and include additional information such as NBT for mod developers.\n\n[Discuss Not Enough Crashes on Discord](https://discord.gg/CFaCu97 \"Discuss Not Enough Crashes on Discord\")\n\n","published":"2021-06-19T08:29:09.200737Z","updated":"2023-09-22T05:58:56.792428Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":245762,"followers":900,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.18-pre5","1.18-rc3","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["fD6rxLF5","P5WNPtGI","2548v2vR","jPyQ9361","ZCLTcpzs","NpzJFMSL","8sqadXeR","MyvZTYij","5jN4a2Bj","lbv17QGj","aEJ0AmmN","2G3Yr014","t9B5ssqU","R7fgU3OB","jMitDhj9","o58sAnwE","kqV2oDrb","YEDodwJw","vot54K7V","65qcAJHD","S4YTUJ1F","e38MENPA","svKaxy7I","Dc7VLhsb","5IokvOtL","UFtF01d9","R9oAIRyo","H834Bypg","BwXDAmse","RuamefJ6","jVQ0oM1Y","Ao38qXJv","S1Wbht3S","1c628dZ5","5RJQ5Cwn","GcXE1LJg","jTVTvng9","FNiqTGuz","jKoZuDmP","xU1wwE7x","jbULmVcB","oRMZK9RZ","X3dO1KWJ","6ZyVIxV2","CwdphWF1","7aPjTHrI","NZvd4cMK","3jOKpa3T","SdZEoBEj","4hioXAif","ycB9upG0","Np7V5yVp","5RGY2gsV","9rwbAj6k","HZlh6stm","pZrUjdgo","FP3OHRgq","lWmXt6Pj","dhdqzAAh","atahrS1a","D7Tg80lr","f3lqB3uY","uC1UhcY0","iYzyejQs","XRyja28g","djywv31z","jfI0mVuC","mQZHQn2N","cThJsa3L","m0fQ0ZnK","ZnZlKNKF","hqUGw7FR","pgS9TDY6","KtTvTMKo","BM5zcr5Q","6Mizjb5I","ujsdfYWT","8DAmDW5A","DvkuebdH","3DmSb3Au","dUMsjI9u","YEZifFXd","QXoGlGqr","qOZAK596"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/yM94ont6/699a0931d0478f9e8614049cc4c060d0f027647e.jpeg"},"version":{"id":"jfI0mVuC","project_id":"yM94ont6","author_id":"gRvRzBFY","featured":false,"name":"Not Enough Crashes 4.4.0+1.19.3 Forge","version_number":"4.4.0+1.19.3-forge","changelog":"## 4.4.0\n- Brand new GUI configuration screen for Not Enough Crashes.

If you want more OptiFine features on Fabric, you can either check [this list](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives), made by LambdaAurora, **or** you can use the [Fabulously Optimized modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized), which includes **all** the OptiFine parity mods!\n\n### Featuring:\n\n- [🎲](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/RANDOM_GUIDE.md) Custom & random entity textures with the OptiFine format, including even more properties!\n- [💡](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/EMISSIVE_GUIDE.md) Emissive/glowing entity textures with the OptiFine format\n- [😑️](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README.md#-blinking-textures) Blinking mobs\n- [🎨](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/SKIN_GUIDE.md) Player skin features\n\n## Compatibility\n\n- OptiFine's random/custom or emissive entity resource packs - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatable**\n- [Entity Model Features (EMF)](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [dorianpb's CEM mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\">  **Fully compatible**\n- [Iris Shaders](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**<br />(Support varies depending on the shader)\n- Mod added entities - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Compatible**<br />(Only if the mod creator used the vanilla rendering code to render their mobs)\n\n## Settings & configuration\n\n- Settings can be changed in-game using [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu), the settings button in the resource pack screen, or  by editing the config file, located under `config/entity_texture_features.json`\n- A few of these options can also be changed via the [Puzzle mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/puzzle)\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/raw/master/.github/README-assets/options.png\" alt=\"Options\" width=\"450\">\n\n## Mod support\n\n- This mod should be compatible with any mod added entities as long as they extend `LivingEntityRenderer` class for rendering and utilise it correctly\n- Any mod displaying an entity in a custom GUI can force the default texture by having the `entity.getblockstate` set to either `null` or of type `VOID_AIR`, the same can be achieved by settings the display mob's UUID to `UUID.nameUUIDFromBytes((\"GENERIC\").getBytes())`. \n\n## FAQ\n\n My entities are invisible/broken!\n\n> Custom Entity Models is not a feature provided by ETF. If your entities are invisible or look corrupted you'll need to instal my other mod [Entity Model Features EMF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) as well (this includes resource packs such as Fresh Animations). Keep in mind that the CEM mod is still in alpha development and may still occur issues.\n\n Blocks and items are not emissive!\n\n> ETF does not support emissive block and item texture, for that you'll need to install [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity).\n\n My game is lagging, help!\n\n> If you are experiencing lag please check your most recent log file to see if any errors are being logged, sometimes an incorrectly written properties file or missing textures may lag the system.\n\n It doesn't work!\n\n> Check if any issues are not actually a problem in the properties file, a few packs seem to be pointing to a texture that doesn't exist.\n So far all mob entities support random & emissive textures, but there may still be some quirks. If you find bugs you can either [report them in GitHub](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/issues/new?assignees=Traben-0&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+%22short+issue+description%22) or get support in the Discord server (linked on the top of the page).\n\n> Emissives are broken with Complimentary shaders, what do I do?\n\n>Complementary shaders has its own in-built emissive textures that usually work fine but will conflict with some resource packs. You can either disable Complimentary's emissives or ETF's emissives to fix this.\n\n My question isn't here!\n\n> Feel free to check ETF's [Discord](https://discord.gg/invite/rURmwrzUcz) to ask your questions or check the FAQ there :)\n\n## Change log\n\n [Changelog](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/common/CHANGELOG.md).\n\n## License\n\nThis mod is under the [GNU

`::accumulated_count(number_order = ascending)`, by default the rule is in descending order.\n\n-   Added full support for [Carpet's](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/carpet) stacable

This is a library mod, it does not add anything on its own.\n\nI do not recommend other modders to build on this as I will ruthlessly break backwards-compatibility as needed for my mods.\n\nNote that this is not a magic solution for running Forge and Fabric mods together, it's only a library my mods will depend on to make publishing for both versions easier.\n\n## Why is this?\n\nI can't just switch to Fabric and abandon all existing Forge users, but I also don't want to miss a Fabric train if there is one.\n\nTrying a port for fun showed that most of the platform-specific things can easily be hidden away from the actual mod code which doesn't have to care about modloader backends, which should hopefully make it much easier to support both mods at the same time.\n\nThere's other libraries that do the same thing, but given the amount of mods I maintain I don't want to put all my money on one boat only to deal with headaches once those other mods stop being supported.\n\n## How does this?\n\nIt just wraps all platform-specific code behind a unified API (in the simplest way possible, there is no magic involved) and provides superclasses to use in cases where platform-specific methods are added to Vanilla classes.\n\nIt also adds a simple network system (similar to Forge's) and a config layer with sync support. For Fabric it depends on Cloth Config, for Forge it will use the default Forge config system in the backend.\n\n## Who is this?\n\nHi, I'm Blay and my Twitter is at [@BlayTheNinth](https://twitter.com/BlayTheNinth).","published":"2022-06-14T18:11:16.556742Z","updated":"2023-09-27T06:42:10.712952Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":283852,"followers":376,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["yIf5KdB1","C0Q1coDV","OxgGZ2zM","DIjNWWDQ","3FaeA4B3","pLCLIILr","KHoU8dQ1","U6WiexwY","KGco8pn9","3gG05xht","yCm0MvD8","bv4c7vz6","HaskpkVN","rLFLPShY","vtPaYjej","jLBnf4l1","i5Q1d7Pr","TQMftlzA","ZI4feWbU","SLR7Xv0p","AhzvhBQj","oqGuqpwK","DENsCzBf","nErKcTp9","xAQtenTo","1pxcbuZv","840UhUoL","9XoBRgjV","6X6csbpx","nFs2ZvOR","NhlpDRNn","zq3nXKQW","TbFmWuAA","O2nbMbp5","C60k8eYK","XYqAzGqP","XNus763a","qUWyGBdD","RAATKbAN","uATqqu4e","lRKNKP0w","ONL5pq9r","FDkt1ohj","o7IqP6Td","DAOUt1Jg","VYTPVkW0","RXK9iX99","wiayzjLV","rbUpGzGA","i8CwYuCi","I5betUED","NRF4uKO7","c1GjX2k1","Zq0Ko2UQ","d7a0S3hj","l551HLmO","BLkvfQ2x","CO57SmJl","ffUlrjOr","jdk8u9nq","x70MCuv3","sBs7NeXN","BJ0Uk3Di","fFosgnEu","qHXzOzUv","YL5MVHnr"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/MBAkmtvl/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"lRKNKP0w","project_id":"MBAkmtvl","author_id":"WE4nCeiO","featured":false,"name":"5.0.4+forge-1.19.3","version_number":"5.0.4+forge-1.19.3","changelog":"- Fixed UseBlock and UseItem events on Fabric not respecting cancellation, causing an issue in Hardcore Revival\n- Fixed loot table modifiers preventing other mods from modifying loot tables dynamically","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-03-17T18:05:15.339224Z","downloads":912,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"fd2632b30a38a6cf11c5e7c04daee6d7f3fb2aa5","sha512":"a07fe6b1a623becf692430ca1358688ae19014aaaf387b0806756e94af6ac9e9dea4a41e35d387381769435c481e15fd07a98178b726396d15e98b8175ad14f2"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/MBAkmtvl/versions/lRKNKP0w/balm-forge-1.19.3-5.0.4.jar","filename":"balm-forge-1.19.3-5.0.4.jar","primary":true,"size":323310,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19.3"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"c1tw4qzj","user":{"id":"WE4nCeiO","username":"BlayTheNinth","name":"BlayTheNinth","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1933180?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-02-28T14:04:06.205061Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"balm-forge-1.19.3-5.0.4.jar"},"mods\\ferritecore-5.1.0-forge.jar":{"sha512":"34039e0a7eb9ef98a1bec58a85a9ed4279c313625c82eeb3fd0d669d668971b770e60abd3672e4d93a7416ebd2352d2e0e24e17a74fd9fd0d81c518fa7756e9e","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"uXXizFIs","slug":"ferrite-core","project_type":"mod","team":"2JhABx1f","title":"FerriteCore","description":"Memory usage optimizations","body":"This mod reduces the memory usage of Minecraft in a few different ways. A high-level technical description of the changes is available [here](https://github.com/malte0811/FerriteCore/blob/main/summary.md).\n\nThe amount of memory saved will depend on the pack. In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB. For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these versions.","published":"2021-04-03T07:04:43.971189Z","updated":"2023-06-08T18:25:55.263079Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":1453035,"followers":3448,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["GeyB7u1y","Mc6hHgQU","hjsymojR","LG5zF5LP","5rLOvzfo","2XHUVaPQ","HjttFjoa","JQl5JoCm","oP38VFTJ","1FrNtQTK","OhmGV4Hp","c9p5gemS","FMdIAsIi","OhuTVpQH","776Z5oW9","AvWRJcqx","zkszypjI","7epbwkFg","xyl3NViI","fwozdl4o","fs07zE6w","6gwDuh90","3UkWIj4a","kwjHqfz7","CtXsUUz6","GHcKib6J","YrvjR5sX","RbR7EG8T","zI3uKvrU","l9p9zXTR","FCnCG6PS","ULSumfl4"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"YrvjR5sX","project_id":"uXXizFIs","author_id":"cXzLZ8YY","featured":false,"name":"5.1.0 (Forge)","version_number":"5.1.0-forge","changelog":"- Update to 1.19.3","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2022-12-08T17:53:44.181068Z","downloads":8959,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"34039e0a7eb9ef98a1bec58a85a9ed4279c313625c82eeb3fd0d669d668971b770e60abd3672e4d93a7416ebd2352d2e0e24e17a74fd9fd0d81c518fa7756e9e","sha1":"a69d589b39e583fdf2b124f2c701a962fb3974e1"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/versions/YrvjR5sX/ferritecore-5.1.0-forge.jar","filename":"ferritecore-5.1.0-forge.jar","primary":true,"size":118413,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19.3"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"2JhABx1f","user":{"id":"cXzLZ8YY","username":"malte0811","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10406104?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-29T18:51:24.633575Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"ferritecore-5.1.0-forge.jar"},"mods\\e4mc-3.2.0+1.19.4-forge.jar":{"sha512":"d09f057ca0b1cfea0d3be2bc5f012908544fc9e7608877b548139f96da0d683dcaa7c852f5bec00aebcb396bf995e415c2bf469af41ede41ed3966ca9f9ca740","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"qANg5Jrr","slug":"e4mc","project_type":"mod","team":"uKJpK4YG","title":"e4mc","description":"Open a LAN server to anyone, anywhere, anytime.","body":"# [e4mc](https://e4mc.link)\n\nOpen your LAN server to the public, easily and quickly!\n\n## What is e4mc?\n\ne4mc is a reverse tunneling reverse proxy for Minecraft.\nIn simpler terms, it's a software that allows you to temporarily expose a local Minecraft server to the internet.\n\n## How do I use it?\n\nSimply install the mod, and Open to LAN as normal.

No longer will you have to give tridents a pass just because they can't accept looting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Also some enchantments have received much needed buffs, and any compatibility restriction between enchantments can be removed (or even added), such as between infinity and mending.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Mryq4Zw.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📚 Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Item Compatibility</strong> for many vanilla enchantments is much expanded upon, meaning you can now apply a lot more enchantments to a lot more items. This offers a number of new compatibilities.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Sword:</strong> Impaling</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Axe:</strong> Sharpness, Smite, Bane of Arthropods, Knockback, Fire Aspect, Looting, Sweeping Edge, Impaling</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Trident:</strong> Sharpness, Smite, Bane of Arthropods, Knockback, Fire Aspect, Looting, Sweeping Edge, Quick Charge, Piercing</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Bow:</strong> Piercing, Multishot, Quick Charge, Looting</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Crossbow:</strong> Flame, Punch, Power, Infinity, Looting</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Horse Armor:</strong> Protection, Blast Protection, Fire Protection, Projectile Protection, Feather Falling, Respiration, Thorns, Depth Strider, Frost Walker, Curse of Binding, Soul Speed, Curse of Vanishing</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Shield:</strong> Thorns, Knockback</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Changes to <strong>Enchantment Compatibility</strong> make a few enchantments no longer mutually exclusive, specifically mending and infinity, piercing and multishot. Furthermore specialized damage and protection enchantments (e.g. smite and blast protection) are now compatible with the respective base enchantment (sharpness and protection).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Item Compatibility and Enchantment Compatibility are fully configurable for every enchantment (even modded, although not officially supported) using an extensive system of <code>json</code> config files. Compatible items and incompatible enchantments can be individually controlled for all enchantments. To read more on how this system works check out the GitHub source repository.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Additionally with some <strong>Enchantment Improvements</strong> infinity no longer requires even a single arrow to be present, and projectiles grant no more temporary damage immunity, making multishot a lot more useful. Any level of feather falling prevents trampling farmland, and last but not least looting boosts xp drops in addition to item drops.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Universal Enchants also includes an option (which is disabled by default) to <strong>Overhaul The Mending Enchantment</strong>: Gear is no longer repaired using xp. Instead, items with mending can be repaired in any crafting grid by combining the durability with another item of the same kind, or by adding repair material. This works similarly to repairing in an anvil, all enchantments are preserved and no xp is taken. This does not work for combining the enchantments of two items though, only the enchantments from the item with mending are kept.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The <strong><code>/enchant</code> Command</strong> receives a much needed overhaul. Enchantments can be applied with any level, and existing enchantments can be overriden or even removed (by setting the level to 0). Even better: The command finally allows for enchanting books.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Roman Numerals</strong> are dynamically generated for enchantment levels and mob effect amplifiers when no language keys are present. This means the full range of valid numerals (1-255) is supported, opposed to vanilla which doesn't support numerals past 10. If roman numerals just aren't for you, all numerals can also be switched to normal numbers.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Mryq4Zw.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷 Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/510/2022-03-13_11.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/511/2022-03-13_11.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>All enchants can be directly applied using enchanting tables or anvils</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>All newly compatible sword enchantments</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/523/2022-03-13_11.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/525/2022-03-13_11.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>All newly compatible axe enchantments</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>All newly compatible trident enchantments</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/528/2022-03-13_11.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/526/2022-03-13_11.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>All newly compatible bow enchantments</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>All newly compatible crossbow enchantments</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Mryq4Zw.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>💡 FAQ:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod on Forge?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Install my <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod and do it directly in-game!</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod on Fabric?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Editing configs directly in-game has not yet been implemented. Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Aren't all those new enchantment combinations kinda overpowered?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> I guess that depends. Some new combinations are extremely useful and should definitely be in vanilla (e.g. infinity crossbows and looting tridents), but yeah, some others might be a bit much. But that has not have to be, since you can disable all enchantments individually in the config. The config includes everything by default for demonstrating all the enchants that are guaranteed to be compatible, fell free to remove any you think are too much.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I can no longer enchant some items added by other mods when Universal Enchants is installed! How can I fix this? (only an issue on Forge)</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Enchanting a few modded items (e.g. Farmer's Delight's skillet) is broken by the internal changes Universal Enchants makes to enchantments. To fix this you'll have to do two things: After installing the mod with the problematic item, delete the universalenchants config folder (found in .minecraft/config) to let it regenerate. It will automatically have additional entries for those problematic items now. Then in the server config enable the <code>allow_mod_item_support</code> option.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Where can I download this mod for Fabric on versions of

These may include flipped or invisible monsters, a sanity bar offset and more. We're not exactly sure why, as OptiFine is closed source. There's many better alternatives here. Also note that even Iris shaders don't work.<br/>\n  ➼ [on optifine](https://tinyurl.com/optifine-is-mid)<br/>\n  \n  __This feature is broken__<br/>\n  Some server or plugin software may cause issues with our datapacks. This notoriously includes Paper, Spigot, Bukkit, Paper and Purpur. You can try to mess around with the config files, but it's recommended to use Vanilla or Fabric, and sometimes Forge with varying results.<br/>\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>\n    💻 Commands 💻\n  </summary>\n\n__You can open up a menu with all custom commands here:__<br/>\n➼ /function nucleus:menu\n\n</details>\n","published":"2022-12-31T00:55:20.954967Z","updated":"2023-06-28T07:04:01.537127Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":13040,"followers":255,"categories":["adventure","game-mechanics","magic"],"additional_categories":["equipment","food","mobs","storage","transportation","worldgen"],"game_versions":["1.19.3","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["datapack","fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["eWske6od","OtR1BsV0","RHSuxT6o","6pHpGkag","sc2lSohl","vWQXLbAl","Eij8qoKG","mFCWfYtk"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n382wpVP/dbd87e51dacfe40b3d02189d9715d5163ebbc13a.png"},"version":{"id":"vWQXLbAl","project_id":"n382wpVP","author_id":"vWnMzXrs","featured":false,"name":"1.0.3 - Hotfix","version_number":"1.0.3+mod","changelog":"This hotfix updates to the latest version of Nucleus and fixes some bugs.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-01-17T07:38:49.710280Z","downloads":4730,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"ad0972572260504793ba337a75018d60782c3f12","sha512":"13564b17f07e0ce710c6055b1a4a676bea83c874307630f949e754c1cbf2e5dd4932a09be124782edf9910a7fc16a2b5dbf385df3f6ac98d74704380f107a595"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n382wpVP/versions/vWQXLbAl/manic-1.0.3.jar","filename":"manic-1.0.3.jar","primary":true,"size":45083450,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19.3"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"hfdg4a5p","user":{"id":"vWnMzXrs","username":"Visi","name":"Visi","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72673832?v=4","bio":"world famous developer or something like that.","created":"2022-12-29T10:22:28.828728Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"manic-1.0.3.jar"},"mods\\skeletonhorsespawn-1.19.3-3.6.jar":{"sha512":"3b28fe1618e4a9a7177289134f8bd7883fc764be9ac1fb21114cefdd5ea43db50151253e68ae26151a21a5d55761f17155a95a6cacaef275187872ace0c5a98a","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"ZcqNoW8j","slug":"skeleton-horse-spawn","project_type":"mod","team":"lBeyy2FV","title":"Skeleton Horse Spawn","description":"☠🐴 Allows skeleton horses to spawn naturally with a skeleton riding it and other tweaks.","body":"<p><a href=\"https://serilum.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://github.com/ricksouth/serilum-mc-mods/raw/master/description/Modrinth/header.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"428\" /></a><br /><br /><strong><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">Requires the library mod&nbsp;<a style=\"font-size: 24px;\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/collective\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Collective</a>.<br /></span></strong></p>\n<p> <strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This mod is part of <span style=\"color: #008000;\"><a style=\"color: #008000;\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/modpack/the-vanilla-experience\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Vanilla Experience</a></span>.</strong><br /><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Skeleton Horse Spawn is a minimalistic configurable mod which allows skeleton horses to spawn naturally with a skeleton riding it.

It allows you to\n\tcustomize the length of the day-night cycle and alters the Minecraft sleep mechanic by accelerating\n\tthe speed of time.\n</p>\n\n## Features\n\nThis mod (optionally) **replaces the vanilla sleep functionality with a smooth and natural transition\nto morning** by accelerating the passage of time while you're in bed. In multiplayer, time will pass\nfaster depending on the percentage of players who are currently sleeping. This removes the need for\nany sleep voting system or player threshold, as any number of players can have an impact on the\nduration of the night.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nHourglass allows for **customization of the day-night cycle duration**, and can control day and night\nspeed independently. Rather than the vanilla duration of 20 minutes, you can slow down time to make\na day in Minecraft last as long as a day in real life, or speed up the passage of nights for a more\nforgiving experience.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nHourglass also provides a number of **time effects** that may speed up the progression of various\nelements in Minecraft to match the current speed of time. Some examples include crop growth, grass\ngrowth, weather, potion effects, furnaces, hoppers, etc. Most of these time effects are disabled by\ndefault but can be enabled by setting their associated [config options](#configuration).\n\n## Compatibility\n\nHourglass is compatible with the following mods:\n\n* [Comforts](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/comforts)\n* [Serene Seasons](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/serene-seasons)\n* [Enhanced Celestials](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/enhanced-celestials)\n* [Quark](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/quark)  \n  * The Improved Sleeping module of Quark interferes with the sleep feature of Hourglass.\n    [See note below.](#sleep-vote-mods)  \n  * The \"Nerf Clock\" Quark option breaks the bed clock in Hourglass. Either the Quark tweak should\n    be disabled or the Hourglass Bed Clock should be disabled via the `displayBedClock` config.\n* [Morpheus](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/morpheus)  \n  * The sleep feature of Hourglass will need to be disabled to use it alongside Morpheus.\n    [See note below.](#sleep-vote-mods)\n* [Good Night's Sleep](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/good-nights-sleep)\n\n#### Sleep Vote Mods\n\nHourglass is compatible with mods that enable sleep voting or have sleep percentage systems like\nQuark and Morpheus, but they conflict with the sleep feature of this mod. These features should\neither be disabled in their corresponding mods, or the sleep feature in Hourglass should be disabled.\nThe sleep feature can be disabled via command or file by modifying the `enableSleepFeature` option.\n\n#### Other Compatibility Notes\n\nThe Overworld is currently the only dimension supported. However, most dimensions in Minecraft\n(including custom dimensions) derive their time information from the Overworld and will therefore\nelapse time at the same rate.\n\n## Commands\n\n#### `/hourglass config <config-key> [<value>]`\n\nModifies or displays the current value of the specified config option.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nIf the `<value>` argument is omitted, this command will display the config option's current value.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nSome configurations are not available through this command and need to be accessed via the config files.\n\n#### `/hourglass query timeSpeed`\n\nDisplays the current speed at which time is elapsing.\n\n#### `/hourglass query sleeperCount`\n\nDisplays the ratio of players sleeping in the current dimension.\n\n## Configuration\n\nAll configuration values can be changed at runtime without reloading the game.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nWhile many of the configuration options are accessible through via the\n[config command](#hourglass-config-config-key-value), some can only be accessed by visiting the\nmod's config files. Most of the options are located in the mod's\n[server config file](#default-server-config) in both single-player worlds and multiplayer servers.\nA few client-specific options also exist in the [client config file](#default-client-config).\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nModpack developers may customize the Hourglass server settings in their modpack by first tweaking\nthe server settings in a test world and then moving the file to the `./defaultconfigs` folder of\ntheir modpack. Forge will move all files in the `defaultconfigs` folder into the `serverconfig`\nfolder of all newly created worlds.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\nWhen customizing Hourglass, the **speed of time** is controlled using a multiplier. A value of 1 is equivalent\nto vanilla speed (20 minutes for a full day-night cycle). Setting daySpeed and nightSpeed to 0.5\nwill cut the speed of time in half, doubling the duration of a full day to 40 minutes. Likewise,\ndoubling the configured speed to 2.0 will result in a shortened day lasting only 10 minutes from\none morning to the next.\n\n> _**Warning:** Setting daySpeed and nightSpeed to values higher than 3600 may be unsafe for people with photosensitive epilepsy._\n\n### Default Server Config\n\nLocation relative to Minecraft folder:\n* Single-player worlds: `./saves/<save>/serverconfig/hourglass-server.toml`\n* Multiplayer servers: `./world/serverconfig/hourglass-server.toml`\n\n```toml\n[time]\n\t#The speed at which time passes during the day.\n\t#Day is defined as any time between 23500 (middle of dawn) and 12500 (middle of dusk) the next day.\n\t#Vanilla speed: 1.0\n\t#Range: 0.0 ~ 24000.0\n\tdaySpeed = 1.0\n\n\t#The speed at which time passes during the night.\n\t#Night is defined as any time between 12500 (middle of dusk) and 23500 (middle of dawn).\n\t#Vanilla speed: 1.0\n\t#Range: 0.0 ~ 24000.0\n\tnightSpeed = 1.0\n\n\t[time.effects]\n\t\t#When applied, this effect syncs the passage of weather with the current speed of time.\n\t\t#I.e., as time moves faster, rain stops faster.

You can roll into any direction you are heading (forwards, backwards, sideways, etc...)\n\nThe combat roll ability has 4 seconds cooldown by default.  (Server side configurable)\n\nCooldown of your combat roll ability can be seen on the main UI (aka HUD). (Client side configurable)\n\nExhaust (aka hunger) is added to the player upon rolling (Server side configurable)\n\nRoll ability can only be used when player is: not using item, not jumping, not swimming.\n\n&zwnj;\n\n## Attributes\n\nThese new entity attributes determine the properties of the combat roll ability.\n\n`combatroll:distance` determines how far the player rolls (the default distance is 3 blocks, server configurable).

There are also new terrain types: canyons, shattered biomes, floating islands, deep ocean trenches, and much, much more.\n\n**Yellowstone** is one of Terralith's staple biomes - a simple and beautiful landscape, based on the real life US National Park. Among the list of realistic biomes are **Yosemite Cliffs**, **Shield**, and many more depending on what you're looking for in a biome. **Highlands** and its variants offer a flat surface to create on - builders can imagine anything from huge mega cities to small simple cottages. Adventurers can explore the breath-taking **Volcanic Peaks** and discover the beautiful **Desert Oases**.\n\nWhile realistic biomes can remind us of the beautiful planet we live on, Terralith offers a plunge into the world of fantasy as well. Adventurers can wander through the purple and mystical **Moonlight Grove** and **Amethyst Rainforest**, or climb the unforgiving cliffs of the **Scarlet Mountains**. If determined, sailers can find the mysterious **Mirage Isles**, or even the elusive and nostalgic **Alpha Islands**. Terralith encourages imagination to run wild here.\n\nIf you feel the surface is too face, have no fear - custom caves lurk beneath your feet! Similar to Minecraft's Lush Cave, the **Underground Jungle** is full of foliage, and rarely some old abandoned houses. Other caves, like **Infested** and **Fungal Caves** are overgrown with spiders and fungi! If you dig super deep, you could stumble upon a sister to the Deep Dark: the **Frostfire Caves** are dangerous and menacing. Beware!\n\n### Structures\nTo tie all of Terralith's magnificent biomes together are it's structures. The ominous tall **Spire** pierces the sky in the iciest biomes. Rarely, you can find **Fortified Villages** in the plains and desert - the villagers have progressed quite far as a society! Finally, if you find yourself lost at night, cold and hungry, you might stumble into the warm protection of the simple Glacial Hut.\n__ __\n\n[![Patron Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786738-7baefaf8-267f-41b6-8ac5-53cc4bd5707e.png \"Join our Patreon!\")](https://www.patreon.com/stardustlabs)\n\n[![Bisect Hosting Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786219-f87f21d2-fb51-4d78-82df-a16e83fe25c9.png \"Use code STARDUST\")](https://www.bisecthosting.com/stardust)\n    ","published":"2022-11-13T21:48:54.507121Z","updated":"2023-10-01T16:41:24.293773Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"required","downloads":161029,"followers":831,"categories":["worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["Q9qUUqA7","Wd3Co0mZ","81tshMIZ","Xf5mFGCS","jUK1mCz3","1latp88m","pNFzTzQd","mLdNNka6","K3S6BASh","aYOzrVFZ","Y4i2gvLB","D0hKeWDQ","JT2esX5R","8N8lLvTW","34PhE3zd","2w1uZoRC","PNByHzei","WZvndtxX","UJtMNPNx","Rq2BBA8A","hYoo0DKV","CDrDiFNK","qFd4s3fV"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8oi3bsk5/34c751cc804839ed3c1d9f21dfd53d98368fedfc.png"},"version":{"id":"mLdNNka6","project_id":"8oi3bsk5","author_id":"oRXQvVNJ","featured":false,"name":"v2.3.8 ~ 1.19.3","version_number":"2.3.8","changelog":"Bug fixes.\n- Fortified Desert Village correctly generates in more biomes\n- Giant Bee Hive now generates with its bees inside of their nests\n- Updated biome colors (WhisperWhite)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-05-23T16:56:17.980120Z","downloads":10988,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"ec59b70c9d78692397434b355769c50b76482c04","sha512":"c554ed340738b59c8c26ce860aaaa59990cb8d0ac0e90dff219cca6f0ecadd86c730574aa6d3e9c7da1ad12d0373c45d4f8fcefe277e1204caf9d810b5a1f794"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8oi3bsk5/versions/mLdNNka6/Terralith_1.19.3_v2.3.8.jar","filename":"Terralith_1.19.3_v2.3.8.jar","primary":true,"size":3050183,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"L2q5L80c","user":{"id":"oRXQvVNJ","username":"Stardust","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/oRXQvVNJ/97f7c767b3b6c78eafb51a2e17f04b36da5d294d.jpeg","bio":null,"created":"2022-11-13T21:48:01.983224Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0},{"team_id":"L2q5L80c","user":{"id":"SR8MIsEo","username":"catter1","name":"catter1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63272345?v=4","bio":"Technical Lead for Stardust Labs.

This display is also now used in the inventory, as it's way more compact and allows for many more effects to be shown before they start to overlap. And this new inventory display is no longer limited to the player inventory, now you can see your active effects in every container!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">But wait, now that status effects are shown small and compact with just an icon, how will you find out how your active effects are called? Don't worry, a handy tooltip is added for that. The tooltip will be even more useful when <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/just-enough-effect-descriptions-jeed\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Just Enough Effect Descriptions</strong></span></a> by <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/mehvahdjukaar\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>MehVahdJukaar</strong></span></a> is installed.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">You like the vanilla inventory status effect display and want to keep it or even use it on the hud as well? No problem! You can choose any widget mode you want, or even none. Alongside that there are many configurable settings, such as the screen side for effects, amount of rows and columns, a custom alpha value, text colors, custom screen positions, and much, much more.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/askYVd2.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷 Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/480/288/2022-07-23_22.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/480/290/2022-07-23_22.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Stylish effects in action being very stylish</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Various effect render types can be chosen and configured</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/480/291/2022-07-23_22.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/480/292/2022-07-23_22.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Compact effects replace the vanilla display inside of the inventory</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>The effects display is shown in every container, not just the inventory</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/480/293/2022-07-23_22.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/480/294/2022-07-23_22.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Useful tooltips will appear when effect widgets are hovered</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>So many possible settings, create your very own effect display</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/480/295/2022-07-23_22.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Great JEI and REI compatibility</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/askYVd2.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>💡 FAQ:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod on Forge?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Install my <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod and do it directly in-game!</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod on Fabric?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Editing configs directly in-game has not yet been implemented. Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor.

The main inspiration comes from scrapped illustrations for what was *supposed* to be the *Wild Update* - this is essentially meant to be a collection of light improvements to vanilla biomes without any new blocks, items, or even new biomes.  \n\nMain changes are made to the rarity and density of certain biome features, such as grass, fern, or flowers. New features are added too - rocks, fallen trees, moss, tree stumps, bushes, and sometimes new types of trees. Most trees are however left almost fully vanilla, with the only change being how tall naturally occurring trees generate, so you don't bump your head so often!  \n\nBasically, this isn't meant to be an epic terrain overhaul, but rather a simplistic and nice way to update the feel of vanilla biomes to the new standard, without making them feel too out of place.  \n\n### 📦 Content\n**1.0.0:** Taiga, Birch Forest, Old Growth Birch Forest, Desert, Flower Forest, Forest, Swamp, Windswept Forest and Windswept Hills  \n**1.1.0:** All above plus Dark Forest, Badlands, Savanna and Savanna Plateau  \n**1.2.0:** All above plus Plains  \n**2.0.0:** Badlands, Birch Forest, Dark Forest, Deep Ocean, Desert, Eroded Badlands, Flower Forest, Forest, Old Growth Birch Forest, Old Growth Pine Taiga, Old Growth Spruce Taiga, Plains, Savanna, Savanna Plateau, Snowy Plains, Snowy Slopes, Stony Shore, Sunflower Plains, Swamp, Taiga, Windswept Forest, Windswept Savanna, Wooded Badlands  \n\nSee the gallery for pictures!\n\n### 📝 Note\nThis mod **only affects vanilla biome files and adds configured and placed features**, which is important because it means it is compatible with other mods and data packs that change the way your terrain generates. It is also fully server-side.  \n\nPlease know that this mod is still in development and new versions may differ slightly. I may make any changes, including the removal of features. While Minecraft can handle this and updating the mod will not corrupt your world, it's still best to make backups.

To edit/disable smooth zooming, edit the `lerp_amount` config option. To disable smooth zooming, set its value to `0`.\n\n### Smooth Camera on Zoom\nThe smooth/cinematic camera is enabled by default when zooming. To disable this, set `smooth_camera_on_zoom` to `false`.\n\n## Modpacks\n\nYou can use Just Zoom in modpacks.\n\n## Special Thanks\n\n**To my patrons:**\n- OtakuGamer\n- Kreezxil\n- q!!!\n- Jolihan\n\n## Copyright\n\nJust Zoom Copyright © 2021 Keksuccino.<br>\nJust Zoom is licensed under DSMSL (DON'T SNATCH MA STUFF LICENSE).<br>\nSee GitHub for more information about the license.\n\n## Server Needed?\n\nYou need a Minecraft server to play with your friends but it's just too much work to setup one on your own?<br>\nNo problem, just rent an ready-to-use server and start playing in a snap!\n\nJust click on the image below and use the code **keksuccino** to get **25% off** your first month!\n\n<a href=\"https://bisecthosting.com/keksuccino\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35544624/100003401-505d5300-2dc6-11eb-9444-3dd117a8aef9.png\" width=\"241\" height=\"244\" /></a><span style=\"color: #808080;\"><br /></span></p>","published":"2023-06-09T23:36:39.409185Z","updated":"2023-09-24T05:25:21.170812Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":4854,"followers":14,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["81bqvjrS","nYoZGwmu","G2VLRt4r","Q1byKePB","WSOuEyWT","MSieP4h1","kUbvKIxI","k3lm0FzI","Yd9leUAD","AjsXN2Tc","mLF7LVql"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/iAiqcykM/086f0578fb6af5f45b60d4ac966df8b2bbda4b76.png"},"version":{"id":"G2VLRt4r","project_id":"iAiqcykM","author_id":"k0LcYHWE","featured":false,"name":"[Forge] v1.0.1-1 MC 1.19-1.19.3","version_number":"1.0.1-1-1.19-1.19.3-forge","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-10T00:01:59.220025Z","downloads":1446,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"97940b62d00ad97ab67e4b60167f49b812abc3f6e8441a50bd13bcc79b708a2ffd803e8135e1af54dd2616e7b3f9b8092b9185187b722dc603796754a5e2282e","sha1":"dde228ee12c32a2a5631ec0aba44fe7f2764146a"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/iAiqcykM/versions/G2VLRt4r/justzoom_forge_1.0.1-1_MC_1.19.jar","filename":"justzoom_forge_1.0.1-1_MC_1.19.jar","primary":true,"size":7849,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"J81TRJWm","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"brmoyUbE","user":{"id":"k0LcYHWE","username":"keksuccino","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35544624?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-03-30T18:22:57.742857Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"justzoom_forge_1.0.1-1_MC_1.19.jar"},"mods\\Clumps-forge-1.19.3-9.0.0+16.jar":{"sha512":"818ae3a97ea18afc98d19e432729b067103d55f5164bbc25dc69b69daa4d74b4b319123a1f80e8db2daca96ab0360d53b4b08e1ecf11005f60fb7d1f119e38a5","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"Wnxd13zP","slug":"clumps","project_type":"mod","team":"twbRaNO5","title":"Clumps","description":"Clumps XP orbs together to reduce lag","body":"Clumps groups XP orbs together into a single entity to reduce lag when there are many in a small area.

The mod adds over 190 new different types of ruins variants to the game, with each having their own unique custom loot tables and include some hidden bosses that you can discover while exploring the lost remnants of ruins. The mod tries to aim for adding ancient ruins to what you see in real life as well as adding lore to Minecraft to improve the game play functionally. Two interesting features that this mod includes is that most loot that you will come across will most likely be buried underground or covered with stones from the ruin itself. Secondly compared to other structure mods, Philip’s Ruins will actually make most of its structures look like ruins. This is done by having the ruin itself blend with the terrain instead of having a rigid drop off at the end of a structure that most mods include during ruff terrain generation. This makes the ruin that you will come across look like it was there before any other structures like villages come to pass. It gives it a vintage ancient look to the current ruin as well keeping the structure along with terrain erosion.\n\nNow if you would like to support the mods development, join our discord where we give updates\non what is going on with the community as well feel free to ask questions about the mod or any topic.

structures ;)</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe initial release was the <b>Desert Decorations</b> update, which included:\n<ul>\n<li>New and improved Desert Wells (including rare <b>Wishing Wells</b> which may have some treasure at the bottom!)</li>\n<li>Desert Obelisks</li>\n<li>Flame Outposts</li>\n<li>And more!</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\nThis mod will receive content updates over time improving different

General Notes\n\n* CraftPresence identifies as a **Client Side-only** mod\n    * This means it **will not run** on the Server's side.\n    * Fabric and Quilt mod loaders will simply ignore the\n      mod, while other mod loaders may crash.\n* Some versions of CraftPresence for Minecraft 1.14.x and above require\n  the [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)\n  and the [Fabric mod loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer)\n* Some versions of CraftPresence for Minecraft 1.13.x require\n  the [Rift API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/rift)\n  and the [Rift mod loader](https://github.com/DimensionalDevelopment/Rift/releases)\n* Versions of CraftPresence for Minecraft 1.1.0 and below\n  require [Risugami's ModLoader](https://mcarchive.net/mods/modloader)\n\n## Features\n\nIn addition to having the ability to change your discord status from \"Playing Minecraft\",\nThis mod offers plenty of customization options to specify entirely how others see you play.\nFrom having your current biome show up, to which dimension your in, as well as which server you're in, and more.\nThe customization possibilities are limitless, with the only real limit being how creative you customize your display.\n\n### Launcher and Pack Integration Support\n\nCraftPresence will detect whether your Launch Directory contains:\n\n* A ATLauncher Instance (instance.json)\n* A valid Twitch/Overwolf/Curse/GDLauncher Manifest (manifest.json, minecraftinstance.json)\n* A MCUpdater Instance (instance.json)\n* A Modrinth Instance (profile.json)\n* A MultiMC Instance (instance.cfg)\n* A Technic installedPacks File (installedPacks)\n\nIf using any of these launchers, note the following:\n\n* Prior to v1.6.0, it'll put the packs name in your display as well as show its icon (when not in a\n  server)\n* From v1.6.0 until v2.0.0, it'll instead parse the Pack's name into the `&PACK&` placeholder, that you can configure\n  for\n  usage in the RPC\n* In v2.0, the pack's info is instead parsed into the `pack.name` and `pack.icon` placeholders, that you can configure\n  for\n  usage in the RPC\n\nAs an example, this is how the mod will convert a pack's name to an iconKey:\n\nExample: `All the Mods 7` would parse as `allthemods7`\n\nNote: MultiMC natively has an Icon Key Property that is used instead of converting from the Pack's Display Name\n\n## Commands\n\nCraftPresence currently offers the following Commands:\n\nKeep in mind the following:\n\n* Commands must be prefixed by either `/craftpresence` or `/cp`\n* In v1.5.0 and above, these commands are only usable via the Commands Gui, found within the Config Gui\n\n___\n\n* `/cp compile \"[expr]\"` - Test the output of a placeholder expression, via Starscript\n* `/cp search (type:typeName, [searchTerm], all)` - Search for valid placeholders available to use with Rich Presence\n* `/cp reload` - Reloads mod data\n* `/cp request` - View Join Request Info\n* `/cp export` - View export commands for mod data\n* `/cp view` - Help command to display the commands available to view and control a variety of display data\n    * `/cp view placeholders` - Displays all available placeholders for use in the RPC\n    * `/cp view currentData` - Displays your Current RPC Data, in text form\n    * `/cp view assets (custom | all)`

can hinder certain portions of the backend in addition to cause certain parts of the mod to not work.\n\nWith this in mind, please note the following:\n\n* **Minecraft 1.16 and above**\n    * As more parts of the game become data-driven, modded data is no longer able to be automatically retrieved without\n      first being in the world.\n    * So far, Biome and Dimension Modules are effected by this change and only display default data, with extra data\n      needing to be discovered first.\n* **Minecraft 1.15 and below**\n    * `MC-112292`: When interacting with the `RenderUtils#drawItemStack` method, used in the v2 Item Renderer, blocks\n      using certain renderers may fail to display properly.\n    * Additionally, on 1.15.x exclusively, z-level issues may occur on Screens using this method\n* **Minecraft a1.1.2_01 and below**\n    * On these versions, the Biome and Dimension Modules are **stubbed** with default data, due to the logic for these\n      methods being missing (Having been initially implemented in Alpha 1.2.6)\n* **Miscellaneous Issues**\n    * Due to obfuscation issues in earlier versions of Minecraft, the Biome and Dimension Modules may fail to\n      auto-detect some necessary information.\n        * As a fallback, the mod is also designed to add selectable Module Data when said biome/dimension is first\n          discovered.\n        * The \"Add New\" option found in some of the module lists can also be used to work around this issue.\n\nAdditionally, in select Minecraft Versions, the following config settings are effected:\n\n* `guiBackgroundColor` (`RenderUtils#DEFAULT_GUI_BACKGROUND`)\n    * MC 1.6 and above: `minecraft:textures/gui/options_background.png`\n    * MC 1.5.2 until a1.1.2_01: `/gui/background.png`\n    * MC a1.1.2_01 and below: `/dirt.png`\n* `stripTranslationColors` (`ModUtils#IS_TEXT_COLORS_BLOCKED`)\n    * This option is forcefully disabled on MC 1.1.0 and below due to various issues regarding TextColor usage,\n      including possible crashes\n    * This change is also auto-applied to existing configs trying to bypass this, unlike the background colors, since\n      resource packs can re-implement those textures\n\n### Icon Requesting\n\nNot seeing an Icon you like or have a suggestion for an Icon to add/modify on the default Client ID?\n\nIf so, you can make a request on my [Issue Tracker](https://gitlab.com/CDAGaming/CraftPresence/issues/), with the\nfollowing requirements:\n\n* If adding an Icon from a dimension, specify the Mod's link that the dimension derives from\n    * This is because specific Icon IDs must be used, which can be found by the mod or from checking your Logs/Chat\n      after entering the dimension as CraftPresence will tell you the ID expected\n* An Icon of size between `512x512` and `1024x1024` to be used (Either minimum or recommended size for best quality)\n    * Icons between these sizes can be used, but may not give a great final quality\n* If requesting an icon to be modified or removed from the Default Client ID, please specify a reason why\n    * Mostly just so it can be logged why it was changed for future reference\n\nAdditionally, you can also create your own Set of Icons by\nfollowing [this guide](https://gitlab.com/CDAGaming/CraftPresence/-/wikis/Making-your-Own-Client-ID-+-Using-your-own-Images)\n\n### Support\n\nNeed some assistance with one of my mods or wish to provide

v2.1.2 (1.19.3)","version_number":"v2.1.2+1.19.3","changelog":"# CraftPresence Changes\n\n## v2.1.2 (07/11/2023)\n\n_A Detailed Changelog from the last release is\navailable [here](https://gitlab.com/CDAGaming/CraftPresence/-/compare/release%2Fv2.1.0...release%2Fv2.1.2)_\n\nSee the Mod Description or [README](https://gitlab.com/CDAGaming/CraftPresence) for more info regarding the mod.\n\n### Changes\n\n* Backend: Multiple Buildscript Overhauls to centralize repeated data and allow for new versioning support\n    * Added support for 1.14, 1.14.1, 1.14.2, and 1.14.3 for the 1.14.4 Build\n    * Added support for 1.15 and 1.15.1 for the 1.15.2 Build\n    * Added a new 1.16.1 Build to cover both MC 1.16.1 and 1.16\n    * Added support for 1.16.2 for the 1.16.3 Build\n    * Added support for 1.16.4 for the 1.16.5 Build\n    * Added support for 1.17 for the 1.17.1 Build\n    * Added support for 1.18 for the 1.18.1 Build\n    * Added support for 1.19.1 for the 1.19.2 Build\n    * Added support for 1.20 for the 1.20.1 Build\n* Placeholder Adjustments for `general` data:\n    * On 1.7.10 and above: `general.version` now properly retrieves the detected MC Version (On lower versions, prior\n      behavior is used)\n    * Added a `general.protocol` version to allow a frontend method to retrieve the detected MC Protocol Version\n    * Added a `data` version for the aforementioned placeholders to differentiate between `detected` and `compiled for`\n      data\n* Added a notice in the `MainUI` for when the Game Version differs from the Game Version the mod was compiled with\n    * Given the newer relaxed versioning, there are cases where things may not work 100% which this warning is meant to\n      symbolize\n    * Primarily, the Per-GUI module may fail in certain cases, due to mismatches in the mapping file that it uses for\n      auto-lookups\n\n### Fixes\n\n* Fixed an issue where Background Rendering could be incorrect in some UIs\n    * Background Rendering now override's stock MC methods rather than using its own method\n    * This will allow some mods to also be able to properly override and interpret the Background State\n    * An additional fix has been made to properly apply the Background to Scroll Lists as well\n* Fixed `.lang` files being missing, leading to Translation Errors and Data Loss on select MC Versions\n    * This was caused from a regression in v2.1.0\n* Fixed an issue where generated `.lang` files, converted from `.json`, would be in the wrong file encoding\n    * This could cause issues such as Color

It is inspired by the similar \\\nmechanics in [Terraria](https://www.terraria.org), but the difficulty also scales with [Regional Difficulty](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Difficulty) to keep Minecraft style. \\\nA detailed description of this mod can be found on the [Wiki](https://majruszs-progressive-difficulty.fandom.com/wiki/Majrusz%27s_Progressive_Difficulty_Wiki). \\\n<b>Since version 0.4.0 this mod requires a [Majrusz Library](https://modrinth.com/mod/majrusz-library) to work!</b>\n\n![](https://github.com/Majrusz/MinecraftCommon/blob/main/ProgressiveDifficulty/game_stages.png?raw=true)\n\nProgress in the game is divided into stages, with each stage providing new difficulty tweaks and \\\nimproving previous ones. At the moment there are three stages:\n\n\\- <b>Normal Mode</b>, which starts at the beginning of the game. \\\n\\- <b>Expert Mode</b>, which starts when the first player enters the Nether. \\\n(or any dimension from other mods) \\\n\\- <b>Master Mode</b>, which starts when you defeat the Ender Dragon.\n\n![](https://github.com/Majrusz/MinecraftCommon/blob/main/ProgressiveDifficulty/stuff.png?raw=true)\n\n### Groups of enemies\nEnemies appear in groups with one leader and \\\nfollowers who attack the same target as the leader. \\\nFollowers are more likely to have weapons and leaders to have armors. \\\n![](https://github.com/Majrusz/MinecraftCommon/blob/main/ProgressiveDifficulty/group.gif?raw=true)\n\n### Undead Army\nThe Undead Army is a new raid which starts after killing a certain amount of \\\nundead enemies. It has up to 5 waves, rewards the player with a treasure bag after \\\nfinishing it, scales difficulty over time and scales difficulty with each player participating in!\n![](https://github.com/Majrusz/MinecraftCommon/blob/main/ProgressiveDifficulty/undead_army.gif?raw=true)\n\n### Treasure Bags\nNew Terraria-inspired bags that contain some extra loot and have \\\na chance for one unique item. Each player receives their own Treasure Bag \\\nwhen they help to defeat a raid/boss. Currently, you can acquire them from: \\\n<b>Fishing</b>, <b>Undead Army</b>, <b>Raid</b>, <b>Elder Guardian</b>, <b>Warden</b>, <b>Wither</b> and <b>Ender Dragon</b>.\n![](https://github.com/Majrusz/MinecraftCommon/blob/main/ProgressiveDifficulty/treasure_bags.png?raw=true)\n\n### Bleeding\nEach animal and human being can now bleed. This is an effect that deals damage similar \\\nto poison and can be removed using a new item: <b>Bandage</b>. It is caused by many different sources \\\nsuch as swords, spiders or even cactuses... but the more armor you have, the less likely you are to bleed. \\\nIt is important to keep bandages with you as the Bleeding becomes more deadly with each stage!\n![](https://github.com/Majrusz/MinecraftCommon/blob/main/ProgressiveDifficulty/bleeding.gif?raw=true)\n\n### Enderium Ingots\nHowever, despite all the difficulty tweaks in the late-game, a new ore called <b>Enderium</b> can be found. \\\nWith this ore, you can make Enderium Ingots which are used to upgrade Netherite armor and tools! \\\n<b>Enderium</b> ore generates in End Stone and can be found in End structures as well.\n![](https://github.com/Majrusz/MinecraftCommon/blob/main/ProgressiveDifficulty/enderium_ingot.png?raw=true)\n\n### And much

compatable with other nether mods, such as Better Nether\n- Do not add this to an existing nether - reset yours first, or use a new world\n\n## Description\nAmplified Nether uses the new 1.18 features to create brand new terrain in the Nether, with 3D biomes and tons of new terrain types. This datapack holds its charm by adding no new biomes, items, mobs, structures, etc... a simple datapack to just make the vanilla Nether better.\n\nAdditionally, Amplified Nether brings back the Nether mountains from the original official Minecraft Nether Update trailer. Many players saw these beautiful mountains, and were upset that they weren't in the game. 3D biomes are used extensively, with much more biome variation. Biome borders that were previously impossible are now commonplace, as any biome can border any other biome!\n__ __\n\n[![Patron Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786738-7baefaf8-267f-41b6-8ac5-53cc4bd5707e.png \"Join our Patreon!\")](https://www.patreon.com/stardustlabs)\n\n[![Bisect Hosting Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786219-f87f21d2-fb51-4d78-82df-a16e83fe25c9.png \"Use code STARDUST\")](https://www.bisecthosting.com/stardust)\n    ","published":"2022-11-23T00:46:33.906695Z","updated":"2023-09-24T19:49:14.126548Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":14786,"followers":201,"categories":["worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["FBqJR2QM","sB14azEN","70trp5am","DwobyjUi","QXFvBT1u","LGRU0B5J"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/wXiGiyGX/1e2c39947ef738f67d7987921dee474c307707e0.png"},"version":{"id":"sB14azEN","project_id":"wXiGiyGX","author_id":"oRXQvVNJ","featured":true,"name":"v1.2.1 ~ 1.19.3","version_number":"1.2.1","changelog":"# Amplified Nether 1.2.1\n\n**Changes**\n- Updated license","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-03-16T10:46:09.453238Z","downloads":4731,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"1374e7d4b1cf9d85142c1aab114905a733c4a221","sha512":"867f674468632a17518de7509bacf00a10d00ee1a851e286efd36f6eaf13616f78d7cee42ed3003b6cad0692962a99a4baf8f97b2d521286024c7476e8931b17"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/wXiGiyGX/versions/sB14azEN/Amplified_Nether_1.19.3_v1.2.1.jar","filename":"Amplified_Nether_1.19.3_v1.2.1.jar","primary":true,"size":103483,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"DANgX5Mb","user":{"id":"oRXQvVNJ","username":"Stardust","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/oRXQvVNJ/97f7c767b3b6c78eafb51a2e17f04b36da5d294d.jpeg","bio":null,"created":"2022-11-13T21:48:01.983224Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Amplified_Nether_1.19.3_v1.2.1.jar"},"mods\\AmbientEnvironment-forge-1.19.3-8.0+4.jar":{"sha512":"81770761477126972d89e3fdf3b2065924787847237ef0f48ac73459be43e9e0d36c6a536459bf02880fcdb4417f32e5e335a33dd90b41fd25eec83751bbf70e","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"DyTvM1dv","slug":"ambient-environment","project_type":"mod","team":"ab8eDoeS","title":"Ambient Environment","description":"Adds more ambiance to a Minecraft world","body":"<p>This mod adds ambient color noise to the biome colors of the game.

The overlay can be disabled in config.\n\nFeel free to post your suggestions about new features in mod!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/tX1BGKb.png)\n\n![](https://s8.gifyu.com/images/1VW3aj_e505c150d02306f9ef2ed8fb090203b3_00-00-00_00-00-31_2.gif)\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/9gq54mY.png)](https://billing.kinetichosting.net/aff.php?aff=102)\n\nYou can check out my other mods too! :)\n\n[<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/q9nPNCY.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"172\">](https://modrinth.com/mod/travelersbackpack) [<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/IWRfBbo.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"172\">)](https://modrinth.com/mod/pizzacraft)\n\n[<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/IkheTqB.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"172\">)](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloud-boots)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nBFWZLJ.mp4)","published":"2023-03-20T19:27:10.523063Z","updated":"2023-10-13T11:39:09.565396Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":989,"followers":30,"categories":["game-mechanics","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["VWCfHPjL","NWvTVZUx","maBbTSYH","kfYrNGOM","WVbfx6UX","ZXs1JjIl","D9tU4cc6","TIUz7BWG","D0n4MRgR","uYPK5LNR","N1inzGEr","20uHqGM4","GJGm8bqe","v9uvp9hF","6cjyMQPg","X0z9UBh0"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1BGsoydA/7b8486486a292d19ebaa4ec8f593d7702f681406.png"},"version":{"id":"maBbTSYH","project_id":"1BGsoydA","author_id":"ARCVguWR","featured":false,"name":"[Forge] [1.19.3] Warrior Rage 1.3.0","version_number":"1.19.3-1.3.0","changelog":"✨ Initial Modrinth release","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-03-20T19:35:55.410280Z","downloads":51,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"536cfdcfa5f51c0ea7cb41ac50e4f117901f8c1f","sha512":"ce25705be9e8e9cc361da160a737c7fb1fbec865cb4f9dee73f8497f5cb4fc3905843c2388ce0602e5f830be5cc20189f76fadf54fff6d7db05ef75a8850b5a1"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1BGsoydA/versions/maBbTSYH/WarriorRage-1.19.3-1.3.0.jar","filename":"WarriorRage-1.19.3-1.3.0.jar","primary":true,"size":27694,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19.3"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"CKWrS56g","user":{"id":"ARCVguWR","username":"Tiviacz1337","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34790800?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-06-11T08:13:48.718411Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"WarriorRage-1.19.3-1.3.0.jar"},"mods\\cloth-config-9.1.104-forge.jar":{"sha512":"16984834c3e71dd5c1116334cca074058304f28dc8320a90ef9a8254954694686fc52e20b9a2c4237293b11fa097995747f308ced75041e3469831bbd30d6c46","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"9s6osm5g","slug":"cloth-config","project_type":"mod","team":"z9omIQMN","title":"Cloth Config API","description":"Configuration Library for Minecraft Mods","body":"[<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZEORx0F.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\"/>](https://discord.gg/Vs9AVkxjYY) [<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/LrVLC2a.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"201\"/>](https://www.patreon.com/shedaniel)\n\nCloth Config API is a config screen api.\n\n### Developers Wiki\n[https://shedaniel.gitbook.io/cloth-config/](https://shedaniel.gitbook.io/cloth-config/)\n\nNeed a server to play with friends?

Under Overworld","description":"Connects the bottom of the overworld to the top of the nether.","body":"**Details:** This datapack/server-side mod allows you to cross the bedrock barrier between the overworld and nether. Standing on bedrock at the bottom of the overworld will teleport you to the same x/z coordinates in the upper layers of the nether, and touching your head against the bedrock at the top of the nether will teleport you to the same x/z coordinates at the bottom of the overworld.\n\nIf you are in adventure or survival mode, the teleportation process will create an air pocket at your destination. If you are in creative or spectator mode, you will still teleport, but an air pocket won't be made so that the world isn't affected by operators or spectating players.\n\n**Compatibility:** Nether Under Overworld is designed to be paired with something like the [No Portals](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-portals) mod that disables the usage of nether portals, as otherwise this can be abused to travel long distances by leveraging the 8:1 scaling between the two dimensions. Since Nether Under Overworld doesn't affect the x/z coordinate when teleporting, this puts the two dimensions on a 1:1 scaling.\n\nWhile the [Immersive Portals](https://modrinth.com/mod/immersiveportals) dimension stacking feature is amazing and connects the two dimensions seamlessly, the mod is required on both the client and server, is performance heavy, and incompatible with a few others that I enjoy, so I decided to make Nether Under Overworld as a budget replacement.\n\nFurthermore, there are two versions of Nether Under Overworld: one for vanilla nethers that are 128 blocks tall, and one for those with a 256 block tall [Amplified Nether](https://modrinth.com/mod/amplified-nether). For those using [Incendium](https://modrinth.com/mod/incendium) and other datapacks that change the nether height to something that isn't 128 or 256, you will need to shift the values in the `nuo:top_nether` predicate and the `nuo:teleport/nether` function accordingly.\n\n**Uninstalling:** Nether Under Overworld can be uninstalled and reinstalled whenever you'd like.","published":"2023-09-05T04:27:11.367102Z","updated":"2023-09-05T04:29:16.641645Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"required","downloads":200,"followers":8,"categories":["transportation"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["datapack","fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["1ekuinYN","GDgWJgdF","TrLG9GML","wDXhETJT"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/mn7UcBW3/141c8874a613db1c1097f81bb019470d52efb7b0.png"},"version":{"id":"wDXhETJT","project_id":"mn7UcBW3","author_id":"gBflFHI3","featured":true,"name":"1.0.0 Amplified - Mod","version_number":"1.0.0+amplified+mod","changelog":"Initial release (amplified version)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-05T04:29:17.449858Z","downloads":131,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"1e9e7f01860c4c64336ac39db258b1033ab74f8257d3b1d26493ebf8e44be116694a3b79ed1ec0c75b1a6dbadf914ec65b66b6f330705588a5aa96de4453483b","sha1":"673b224adf84cf9d420d41d0e9e3bf8a90e8e412"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/mn7UcBW3/versions/wDXhETJT/nether-under-overworld-1.0.0a.jar","filename":"nether-under-overworld-1.0.0a.jar","primary":true,"size":7830,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"LoX50ccX","user":{"id":"gBflFHI3","username":"badooga","name":"badooga","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33851191?v=4","bio":"I make stuff sometimes.\n\nSocials: linktr.ee/badooga","created":"2023-04-25T06:34:27.528489Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"nether-under-overworld-1.0.0a.jar"}},"modrinth_update_version":"F1auFNBv"}
